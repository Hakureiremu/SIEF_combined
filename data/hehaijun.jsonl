New laws I helped pass, like the CHIPS &amp; Science Act, are already helping create good-paying Michigan jobs. I’ll fight to strengthen worker rights &amp; the middle class. \n\nWe need to manufacture more here in Michigan—not overseas—to strengthen our supply chains. That’s why I helped pass the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act. This new law is already creating hundreds of good-paying Michigan jobs, &amp; I’ll keep working to strengthen U.S. manufacturing. \n\nHundreds of new jobs are coming to mid-Michigan! Thanks to the CHIPS and Science Act, we’re strengthening American manufacturing and creating good-paying Michigan jobs at companies like Hemlock Semiconductor. \n\nWe cannot depend on other countries for critical components to our economy like chips. That’s why I worked with Republicans and Democrats to pass the CHIPS and Science Act into law—helping to make today’s groundbreaking at Hemlock Semiconductor possible. \n\nIt’s no surprise Flint workers are producing some of the most popular trucks on the market; we put the world on wheels! I helped pass the CHIPS and Science Act to strengthen American auto manufacturing &amp; create good-paying manufacturing jobs here in Michigan—not overseas. \n\nMichigan put the world on wheels a century ago. A lot has changed since then, but Michigan workers remain the best in the world. I voted for the CHIPS and Science Act &amp; Inflation Reduction Act so Michigan remains a leader in auto manufacturing, keeping good-paying jobs at home. \n\nOver the last two years, we’ve seen thousands of jobs created in mid-Michigan. Legislation I helped pass like the CHIPS and Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act are helping to boost U.S. manufacturing and strengthen domestic supply chains. \n\nMid-Michigan put the world on wheels. 150 good-paying jobs at SK Siltron’s new Bay City facility shows that we can bring back manufacturing to Michigan with new laws like the CHIPS and Science Act &amp; Inflation Reduction Act. \n\nMore good-paying jobs are coming to mid-Michigan! New laws I helped pass, like the CHIPS &amp; Science Act and the Inflation Reduction Act, are poised to create 170 new good-paying jobs. I'll continue working to pass legislation that creates manufacturing jobs in MI—NOT overseas. \n\nWe have to make things in Michigan &amp; America if we want to be a strong &amp; prosperous country. The CHIPS and Science Act, which is now law, boosts manufacturing here—NOT in China. \n\nHelped open SK Siltron’s new manufacturing plant in Bay County! This semiconductor plant is creating 150 good-paying jobs here in mid-Michigan. It’s a great example of how the CHIPS and Science Act is helping our local economy grow. \n\nThis facility is why I helped pass the CHIPS and Science Act—to bring critical manufacturing back to Michigan. I’ll keep working to create good-paying jobs in mid-Michigan and decrease our reliance on foreign-made chips. \n\nThe CHIPS &amp; Science Act, which was recently signed into law, includes my legislation to help make more semiconductors in America. These investments will help us compete against China, lower costs for families &amp; create good-paying jobs.\n\nWhen we make things in Michigan and America, we have a strong and prosperous country. New laws I helped pass—like the CHIPS and Science Act—are bringing good-paying jobs back home. \n\nBy investing in American clean energy and manufacturing, the #InflationReductionAct is creating good-paying manufacturing jobs in Michigan—not in China. Look no further than mid-Michigan's @hscpoly in Hemlock, hiring Michigan workers to support our solar supply chain.\n\nWith this new law, we’re going to make more semiconductors here in America—NOT China. Made in the USA = good-paying jobs, fixing broken supply chains &amp; lowering costs for families. \n\nAt @HscPoly in Hemlock today to celebrate the passage of the CHIPS and Science Act! Our economy shouldn’t be reliant on foreign-made semiconductors from China. This bipartisan legislation means thousands of Michigan JOBS and lower costs for consumers. \n\nSemiconductors are in everything—from cars to phones. We need to make more chips in America! By incentivizing semiconductor manufacturing, we can lower costs, boost MI’s economy, create good-paying jobs &amp; ensure that we have resilient supply chains that don’t rely on China.\n\nIn my hometown of Flint, cars are sitting in parking lots—just waiting for foreign-made semiconductor chips. I’m working to boost the domestic production of these chips, to support Michigan jobs and fix broken supply chains. \n\nAmerican-made cars shouldn’t be reliant on foreign-made semiconductor chips. I’m working in Congress to bring this critical manufacturing back to America and create good-paying Michigan jobs. My legislation will help lower costs for consumers and strengthen our economy.\n\nWe cannot be reliant on China for solar panels made with slave labor. Michigan workers can out-compete anyone, but only if they have a level playing field. I’ll keep working in Congress to support Michigan workers and stand up for America’s solar industry. \n\nThousands of cars are sitting in Flint, just waiting for foreign made chips. That's unacceptable. I'm proud to work with Republicans and Democrats to help bring this kind of critical manufacturing back to America by investing in Michigan workers. \n\nBecause of the #AmericanRescuePlan, we are seeing the fastest economic growth rate in nearly 40 years. In one year we have seen:  6.5 million jobs added  Unemployment dropped to around 4 percent  Economic growth faster any other nation, including China #SOTU\n\nThe #AmericaCOMPETESAct will help fix our broken supply chains by building more critical components like semiconductors here in America—not overseas in China—helping lower costs for families and seniors. \n\nWhen we strengthen domestic manufacturing, we can fix supply chain issues, create jobs here in the U.S. and lower costs for families. The #AmericaCOMPETESAct will promote making things in America and ensure we are not dependent on China for our economic future.\n\nWe must level the playing field for Michigan workers. I’m proud to support the #COMPETESAct to secure our critical supply chains, lower costs &amp; invest in critical innovation to ensure we can compete in a 21st century economy and be economically competitive against China.\n\nThis is huge news! When we incentivize U.S. manufacturing and make things here in America, supply chain issues won't be a major disruption in the future. I've been leading bipartisan efforts to strengthen U.S. supply chains &amp; address the chips shortage: \n\nFire up Chips!   \n\nI applaud @POTUS for signing this bipartisan legislation into law. This new law will ensure that Chinese products are not made with forced labor, upholding our democratic values as Americans and leveling the playing field for Michigan workers against unfair trade practices. \n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

Read more about bipartisan legislation I helped intro to KEEP jobs in  #MI06 \n\nFor months, the Biden Admin has resorted to importing oil &amp; gas from the Middle East, Russia, &amp; even China to solve their policy blunders. I suggest that we encourage American energy production here at home that will actually lower gas prices and heating bills for folks in #MI06. \n\nThe Ocean Shipping Reform Act - intro'd by my @ProbSolveCaucus colleague @RepDustyJohnson - is good, bipartisan legislation that will help unclog our ports &amp; hold Chinese freighters accountable that refuse to transport American goods. Securing our supply chain is a TOP priority. \n\nThe Strategic Petroleum Reserve was designed for energy emergencies, not policy blunders. Instead of relying on Russia &amp; China for our energy needs, we should be boosting energy production in America. Check out my bill w\/ @cathymcmorris &amp; @SteveScalise \n\n🚨On Tuesday night, I voted for the FY 22 National Defense Authorization Act which received STRONG, BIPARTISAN support. This bill includes: A pay raise for our troops Resources to deter Chinese &amp; Russian aggression A commission to study the botched Afghanistan withdrawal\n\nChina spent more in 3 years on cement than we’ve spent in 100. If we want to emerge as a global leader on trade &amp; economic might, we better get with it on infrastructure. From broadband &amp; energy security to roads &amp; bridges, rebuilding our infrastructure is the least we can do.\n\nLowering prescription drug costs &amp; finding more cures to the world's cruelest diseases doesn't have to be mutually exclusive. Unfortunately, my Dem colleagues' partisan govt pricing drug plan would stifle innovation, empower China &amp; lead to fewer lifesaving cures for patients. \n\nThe U.S. produces only 12% of the global chip supply compared to some 37% in 1990. They are critical to our economy &amp; our national security. That’s why we need to fund the CHIPS for America Act &amp; increase domestic chip manufacturing in MI &amp; nationwide. \n\nThe Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill is a long overdue investment in American infrastructure, American jobs &amp; American competitiveness. To help solve the supply chain crisis &amp; compete w\/ China, we need to repave our roads &amp; highways, rebuild our bridges &amp; modernize our ports. #MI06 \n\nChina has invested more money in rebuilding their infrastructure in just 3 years than we’ve spent in 100. That needs to change. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill will help us compete against the likes of China, power the American economy, and support American workers.  \n\nIn 2019, America was energy independent for the first time in 70 years. Now, we’re relying on OPEC, Russia &amp; China to power our economy. Releasing oil from the SPR is a very temporary measure that won’t solve our supply chain issues or reduce gas prices. \n\nWe can’t continue to rely on foreign countries for the chips American businesses &amp; consumers need. That’s why @RepDebDingell &amp; I are urging House leadership to fully fund the CHIPS for America Act. This bipartisan bill will go a long way to secure American chip manufacturing. \n\nIf the Democrats' $4T tax-&amp;-spend plan becomes law, the U.S. will have the HIGHEST tax rate in the WORLD. This will only hurt hardworking Americans &amp; small businesses, while helping China &amp; Russia. We should be LOWERING taxes - not aiding our adversaries. \n\n…expand broadband to underserved communities, strengthen our energy grid against Russian &amp; Chinese cyberattacks &amp; create jobs across SW MI…\n\nRepublicans have offered several commonsense amendments to the partisan $3.5T spending spree that would: Cut taxes for our farmers Secure  energy independence End our reliance on Chinese supply chains Fund the police Unfortunately, Democrats blocked them all. #MI06\n\nFor 100 years, the CCP has subjugated the Chinese people to ineffective one-party rule, silenced political dissidents &amp; committed glaring human rights abuses. This anniversary is no time for celebration. It’s a real reminder that freedom is a gift &amp; democracy is precious. #MI06 \n\nTragically, more than 4M people - including 600K Americans - have died from COVID &amp; we still know very little abt the origins of this awful virus.

The Chinese government is one of the major strategic threats our country faces right now. Establishing a Committee that takes a wholistic view of legislation &amp; policy is important for our national security and our economy. 1\/2 \n\n3\/ In the few months since we passed the CHIPS Act, a whole bunch of companies have already announced plans to build chip plants in the U.S. That means more good-paying manufacturing jobs and a stronger supply chain for chips.\n\nI just got back to DC from our CODEL to the Middle East last night, and this morning I flew to Bay City with @RepDanKildee and @POTUS for an event to talk about how the CHIPS Act is going to bring manufacturing back to places like Michigan. 1\/ \n\nIn 2021, I led a bipartisan task force in the Armed Services Committee to look at vulnerabilities in our defense supply chains, &amp; our findings raised serious red flags about our military’s dependence on materials from halfway around the world, including adversaries like China.\n\n2\/ China’s actions aren’t merely speculation &amp; rumor, they are known &amp; publicized influence operations. Their efforts are not in keeping with international rules &amp; norms, nor are they consistent with the freedoms &amp; rights enjoyed by American citizens or anyone else on U.S. soil.\n\nFor many in the national security world who've been tracking China’s subversive efforts in the U.S., this is no surprise. But it's a wake-up call when it comes to countering concerted attempts by Chinese intelligence to undermine American institutions. 1\/ \n\nPeter shared with me how many new forges &amp; presses are being built in China, and that more and more manufacturers are now sending their equipment overseas to be repaired. In addition to economic costs &amp; domestic job losses, this raises big national security red flags for me. 2\/3\n\nWe need to use every tool at our disposal to keep the upper hand when it comes to China — that includes making sure we’re not exporting sensitive, high-tech equipment to an adversary that could one day use it against us. 1\/2 \n\nWeaning ourselves — and especially our military equipment — off of critical Chinese components doesn’t just happen in its own. It will require policy and law to ensure our economic and national security. 5\/\n\nHere’s the thing: our reliance on China undermines our economic AND national security. That’s why I'm leading bipartisan bills to keep us safe. The latest - the REEShore &amp; HARD ROCK Acts - build up our critical mineral stockpiles to prevent this exact situation with the F-35. 4\/\n\nWe found that microchips and the rare earth minerals that make them were an important vulnerability for @DeptofDefense, and passed bipartisan legislation pushing DOD for greater supply chain transparency. 3\/\n\nThe supply chain story continues: In 2021, after our dependencies on Chinese products like masks became clear during COVID, @RepGallagher &amp; I wondered what dependencies the U.S. military might have on China. 1\/ \n\nThe bipartisan infrastructure law, CHIPS Act &amp; the Inflation Reduction Act will build on this momentum to bring our supply chains back from places like China &amp; create jobs with dignity here in Michigan.\n\nIt was great to hear their enthusiasm and optimism for the future when we talked about the CHIPS Act and how bringing microchip production back to the U.S. means more stability for the entire auto industry and more jobs for American workers. As Rosie said, “We Can Do It!”\n\nAs a parts supplier to GM, these women have lived through multiple shut downs over the past year due to the chips shortage and other supply chain issues.\n\nWe need to make chips here — in America — and help our farmers, who have spent the last couple years grappling with the microchip shortage. Today’s high-tech farming equipment runs on chips, so the shortage has made it much harder for regular folks to repair.\n\nLastly, I wasn’t surprised to hear the continued serious strain on our supply chains for farmers, and in particular how badly the microchip shortage is impacting farm equipment. This is another place where the CHIPS Act we passed a few weeks back will help.\n\n6\/ And Given the Pentagon’s strict buy-American requirements for contractors, making these chips here, in the U.S., is critical for our military &amp; our national security.\n\nThe signing of the CHIPS Act is a *huge* win for Michigan. Not only will it energize our domestic microchip industry - keeping Michigan’s auto plants open &amp; their workers on the line - it will also be revolutionary for universities like @MichiganStateU. 1\/ \n\nAnd as we landed, the Chinese military squawked at our Air Force pilots over the radio, and later sent 27 military aircraft into Taiwan’s ADIZ in response. This is a sensitive time in China, but now that the Speaker’s trip is public, she can’t back down to Chinese threats. 2\/2\n\nI visited a Taiwan with a codel in November, and scare tactics are par for the course for the Chinese government: the Chinese Embassy sent a threatening, over-the-top letter to our office to try to dissuade us from visiting. 1\/2 \n\n3\/ The national security implications are just as important: By bringing this manufacturing back home, we’re ensuring that we can’t be held hostage by our adversaries in the event of a conflict with countries like China.\n\n2\/ By incentivizing companies to build new microchip plants here in the U.S., instead of places like China, this bill helps prevent future shortages like the ones that have shut down auto plant across the country, including GM’s Delta Township and Lansing Grand River plants.\n\nI’ve been waiting more than a year to cast my vote for the CHIPS Act, and today I finally got the chance. Passing this bill is a huge win for Michigan’s workers, our businesses and our national security. 1\/ \n\n6\/ If we don’t shift some of this chip manufacturing to the US, we’ll have to accept that we’re beholden to foreign suppliers. These microchips are fundamental to nearly every part of our society, &amp; if we in Congress fail to act, we will lose out on a generational opportunity.\n\n5\/ I’ve met too many Michigan auto workers who have been laid off because their plant couldn’t find enough 14-cent microchips to stay open. Right here in my district, GM has had hundreds of finished cars sitting on the lot because they are missing chips.\n\n3\/ Right now, just 2% of the storage &amp; memory chips used in our cars and televisions are manufactured in the US, but the CHIPS Act levels the playing field &amp; opens us up to more investment in Michigan and across the country.\n\n2\/ Other countries like China are pouring billions into building up their own microchip manufacturing capacity, making their chips about 40% cheaper to produce. If we want to compete, we need to make these investments.\n\nThis morning I sat down with representatives from Micron, one of the world’s largest chip manufacturers. Our conversation made it clear that if we want America to be a global leader in chip production, it’s crucial that we pass the CHIPS Act &amp; related investment tax credits. 1\/ \n\nThe chip shortage is a threat to Michigan's economy AND our national security - that's why we need to pass the CHIPS Act on its own. If Congressional leaders screw this up, the consequences will be dire. Read my op-ed in the @DetroitNews: \n\n2\/ These are the holdover tariffs President Trump imposed. The Chinese retaliated with a whole package of their own tariffs on American goods, especially ag products — then the Trump administration offered subsidies to ease the pain on our farmers.\n\nI got asked about the administration potentially lifting tariffs on Chinese imports. As we look to what to do, I come at this from my work at the Pentagon: it’s all about leverage. 1\/ \n\nWe need to invest now in an American supply chain for microchips, so that we aren’t beholden to foreign countries like China for our economic and national security. It’s time to pass the deeply bipartisan CHIPS Act as a standalone bill.\n\n.@GM’s Delta Township plant is shutting down - again - because we can’t get ahold of 14-cent microchips. Congress’s failure to pass the CHIPS Act has real world consequences, and it’s leaving workers in mid-Michigan holding the bag. \n\n2\/ We covered a range of issues, including expanding rural broadband access, keeping the U.S. competitive with China, and leadership lessons for young women interested in government.\n\nChina’s current control over the market for these minerals leaves us dangerously vulnerable. By shoring-up our stockpile and improving transparency, we can make sure we aren’t left defenseless in the event of a trade dispute or military conflict.\n\nLast year I led a bipartisan task force to examine our defense supply-chains. We took a close look under the hood &amp; didn’t like what we saw. So today, I’m unveiling 2 new bills to reduce our reliance on China for critical minerals used by our military. \n\nWhen it comes to microchips, I can promise you that China isn’t dragging their feet. We need your push to have any chance of getting this done by August 1.\n\nAs much as I love to hear that Russia’s military has been forced to use chips from dishwashers, the global shortage is a huge threat to our own national AND economic security. Shame on Congress for dragging our feet on the Bipartisan Innovation Act — we need to pass it now. \n\nThe U.S. produces only 12% of the world’s chips and 0% of the most advanced chips needed for household devices, military devices, &amp; — critically for Michigan — our cars.\n\nJust had a strong briefing from the @DeptofDefense + the @CommerceGov on the microchip supply chain and the need to move smartly on the CHIPS Act funding and the America COMPETES Act as a whole.\n\nI want our kids working for American companies, not Chinese companies – and no matter which way you cut it, Michigan is honoring its heritage and owning the next generation of auto manufacturing.\n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

In particular: can a right to rebellion survive in a surveillance state as totalizing as today’s under “Emperor” Xi Jinping’s?\n\nFor folks who have studied Chinese history, it’s hard not to make connections between these authoritarian times and the many centuries of dynastic rule in China.\n\nI read whatever I can find about China’s recent wave of protests. Many articles, like this one, talk about problems deeper than COVID lockdowns behind the protests. 🧵 \n\nChina’s effort to wipe out Tibetan culture is no less heinous for being slow moving &amp; out of the spotlight.

We need to ban TikTok in America. @FoxBusiness \n\nChina lied, and Americans died. \n\nCommunist China uses TikTok to spy on Americans. The House must move quickly and pass the Senate's bill that bans TikTok on government devices.\n\nOn top of that, we stopped the Democrats from putting more wokeness into the military. Additionally, this bill gives our soldiers a pay raise and helps modernize our military to help combat China. Overall, the NDAA is a win for our military, our country, &amp; our national security.\n\nThe protesters in China are fighting back against censorship and oppression. The display of blank paper shows that although they are voiceless, they are still powerful. I am proud to use my voice to stand up to this abusive Chinese regime and support those fighting for freedom. \n\nI stand with the protesters in China that are fighting for freedom against Beijing's tyrannical communist regime.\n\nApple removed AirDrop in China because protesters had been using the tool to fight the #CCP. Big Tech is not on the side of human rights. \n\nOur National Defense Strategy should be focused on Russia, China, and Iran - not the left's woke climate change policies.\n\nRepublicans' #CommitmentToAmerica is a pledge to strengthen our supply chains. If the pandemic taught us anything, it's that we are too reliant on China. We must move our supply chains back to the U.S. and produce right here in America.\n\nForget Iran, China, and Russia; our State Department is laser-focused on the one issue that matters: funding drag shows in Ecuador. This Administration has clearly fallen off the deep end with the woke mobs. \n\nToday marks the 111th National Day for Taiwan! To our great friend and ally, enjoy the day celebrating your sovereignty and freedom!\n\nThere is absolutely no reason Michigan should be doing business deals with companies tied to the Chinese Communist Party. We must keep the #CCP out of our state and our country. \n\nChina shouldn’t own our farmland. PERIOD.\n\nI fully support a free trade agreement between the U.S. and Taiwan. It is vital that we work with our friend and ally as they confront the unending threats from the vicious #CCP.\n\nJoe Biden is failing to prepare the U.S. against China, and the #CCP knows it.\n\nThe Biden Administration is weak and the vile Chinese Communist Party knows it.\n\nThe #CCP is a tyrannical regime hellbent on terrorizing Taiwan and its democratic values. Beijing’s announcement of aggressive military exercises and sanctions is despicable, but unsurprising. The U.S. must always stand by Taiwan.\n\nThis is despicable. The U.S. should always support the democratic and free Taiwan over the tyrannical #CCP. \n\nWhile Americans continue to suffer from historic prices at the pump, President Biden is selling oil from our strategic reserve to communist China. At what point does the lunacy stop? We must hold this Administration accountable for their outrageous actions. \n\nBiden sold nearly one million barrels of American oil to China but is making you pay $5\/a gallon.\n\nPresident Trump put America first. President Biden is putting China first.\n\nThe CCP must be held accountable for their blatant spying on American citizens. We cannot allow Beijing to get away with this. That's why I introduced the ACES Act to dismantle ByteDance's association with TikTok and take this power out of Communist China's hands.\n\nThe Communists in Beijing are upset that the U.S. is supporting a democracy on the path to independence. Make no mistake about it, we will always stand with the people of Taiwan. \n\nRussia and China are flying bombers on Japan's doorstep during Biden's visit. They aren't doing this because they think Biden is a strong leader. \n\nGeneral Milley said that the war with China will be predominantly fought by our air and maritime forces. Why then does the Biden Defense budget fail to provide the Air Force with the aircraft they need? VIDEO FROM HEARING \n\nI’m proud to receive the Waste Warrior award from @WhiteCoatWaste for my work to fight cruel, dangerous and unnecessary taxpayer-funded animal experiments in the U.S. and abroad, especially in adversarial countries like Russia and China. \n\nI joined @CapitolReport to discuss #China's increased aggression and the inflation crisis here at home. \n\nRussia is attacking our allies in Ukraine, China is prepping to attack our ally Taiwan, and Iran is attacking Americans in Iraq. Is this what a Biden foreign policy looks like? Is this what VP Harris said the American people voted for?\n\nI introduced the AFAR Act to stop your taxpayer dollars from funding animal testing in countries like Russia and China. It's critical, now more than ever, that we stop funding these inhumane practices. \n\n#China is complicit in Putin’s war in Ukraine.

The new @StateDept cyber bureau, led by Maine's @ncfick, is a first step to reaching this goal. Appreciate the @ReaganInstitute letting me share my thinking on this national priority. \n\nThank you @ReaganInstitute for the opportunity to speak on the importance of cyber deterrence, and the role of private industry in protecting our nation from foes like Russia and China. It was a pleasure to join @nancyayoussef @SecAFOfficial @CYBERCOM_DIRNSA for the conversation. \n\nOur China Grand Strategy Commission wouldn't just create a report that sits on a shelf. Much like the @CyberSolarium, it would implement real action to secure America's 21st century success.

This bill is a win for Michigan workers, manufacturers and our economy. Proud to have led the charge with @SenStabenow to support our auto sector, create jobs, lower costs for families and bolster our national security.\n\nFrom China to India &amp; in Europe, foreign governments are heavily investing in the production of semiconductor chips. The Chips &amp; Science Act—which I helped pass the Senate today—will boost our manufacturing here at home, create jobs, and lower costs for families. \n\nBREAKING NEWS: The Senate passed the bipartisan Chips and Science Act to bolster semiconductor chip production at home—a huge win for Michigan workers, manufacturing &amp; our economy.\n\nI’ll be joining @Morning_Joe shortly to discuss how the CHIPS Act will expand domestic chip production, support jobs, strengthen supply chains &amp; lower costs for our families. Tune in!  \n\nHey Siri: Play Steely Dan. Whether you’re playing your favorite song or lowering your windows, chips are critical to our cars—and so many aspects of our daily lives. We’re on the cusp of passing the CHIPS Act. WATCH  \n\nFrom cars, to appliances, to computers, to missile defense systems, our daily lives depend on semiconductor chips that can be as small as a fingernail. The CHIPS Act will expand domestic chip production, support jobs, strengthen supply chains &amp; lower costs for our families. \n\nIt was great to join @SenStabenow @MEMADC &amp; @LearCorporation in Southfield. We highlighted how the CHIPS Act will provide critical funding I secured with @SenStabenow to ensure we can bring semiconductor chip manufacturing back home and support our Michigan automakers &amp; workers. \n\nI joined @SenStabenow in Southfield to discuss how the CHIPS Act will bring good-paying jobs to Michigan, strengthen supply chains, lower costs for families &amp; strengthen national security. Let’s get this across the finish line to manufacture semiconductor chips here at home. \n\nYou can’t be a great country if you don’t make things. I voted to move forward on CHIPS legislation, which is important to Michigan &amp; the U.S. This bill has funding I secured with @SenStabenow to expand domestic semiconductor chip production, including for our auto manufacturers.\n\nIt’s unacceptable and unconscionable to cede American innovation and economic opportunity to foreign competitors, like the Chinese government. I will continue to stand up for Michigan and American workers and fight for efforts that spur job creation and innovation in the Senate.\n\nYou can’t be a great country if you don’t make things. I couldn’t agree more with our auto leaders. As a member of the committee negotiating the econ competitiveness bill, we must finalize it &amp; include provisions to strengthen the domestic production of semiconductor chips. \n\nGreat to meet with Ambassador @bikhim. The U.S. has a close relationship with Taiwan—and I’m committed to building on our close bonds and expanding economic opportunities. And our friendship with Taiwan is the lynchpin of a free &amp; open Indo-Pacific.  \n\nIt was great to join @DepSecGraves in Detroit today for a roundtable on the need to strengthen domestic manufacturing of semiconductor chips. I’ll keep working to ensure we build these chips &amp; create good-paying jobs right here in America. \n\nThe Senate took an important step on moving the competitiveness bill forward. Now the hard work begins to negotiate a final bill that will strengthen our economy, create good-paying jobs for Michiganders and expand domestic manufacturing of semiconductor chips.\n\nI was proud to help secure this funding through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to lessen our dependence on foreign producers like the Chinese government for these critical technologies—and help our automakers meet the growing demand for cleaner, safer cars.\n\nAs small as a fingernail, semiconductor chips can power everything in a car from windows to navigation displays. It’s why we must finalize this economic competitiveness bill—so we can make these chips right here in America &amp; create good-paying jobs. \n\nMichigan has always been at the forefront of mobility and a global leader in auto manufacturing. The CHIPS Act will make sure Michigan workers—who can outcompete &amp; outwork anyone—will keep leading the 21st-century mobility race. \n\nMichigan is home to the best autoworkers in the world—who can out-compete and outwork anyone. @UAW's Steve Dawes explains why strengthening the CHIPS Act will help workers in Michigan. \n\nThe semiconductor chip shortage is not only hurting workers and manufacturers in Michigan but impacting our competitiveness on the global stage. It’s why we must shore up domestic production—and why the CHIPS Act is a win for Michigan. \n\nBy investing in the domestic production of semiconductor chips we can increase jobs, boost the economy, and strengthen our national security. @KLAcorp’s Jay Rathert explains why the CHIPS Act does just that &amp; helps the U.S. remain competitive on the global stage  \n\nWhether it’s semiconductor chips for the auto industry or other essential goods and materials, we need to expand domestic manufacturing. I’ll keep working to finalize a competitiveness bill that strengthens our economy while shoring up our supply chains. \n\nNow it’s time to negotiate a final bill between the Senate and House to strengthen U.S. manufacturing and domestic production of semiconductor chips, expand STEM education &amp; create thousands of good-paying jobs. We must get it done.\n\nSemiconductor chips can be as small as a fingernail. In cars, these chips power everything from engines to windows to navigation displays. We must invest in expanding domestic production of these chips for jobs, our economy and national security. \n\nBottom line: we must remain focused on making our supply chains resilient by manufacturing critical goods in America. That includes semiconductor chips, but also other supplies that are essential to millions of American jobs &amp; auto manufacturing. More from my field hearing \n\nI’m chairing a Commerce Committee field hearing in Detroit to examine how Congress can bolster U.S. innovation for electric and autonomous vehicles—especially by increasing domestic production of semiconductor chips, while also delivering good-paying jobs for Michiganders. \n\nSemiconductor chips will power the autonomous &amp; vehicles of the future that we will manufacture in Michigan. I’ll be chairing a hearing in Detroit next week about making our semiconductor supply chains resilient &amp; maintaining global leadership in the auto industry. \n\nFor our economy &amp; national security, it’s imperative that we increase domestic manufacturing of semiconductors. We must ensure competitiveness legislation being negotiated in Congress includes full funding for chips production—including provisions @SenStabenow &amp; I authored.\n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

I’ll keep working to find a path forward that protects our solar companies while boosting US manufacturing and holding China accountable. \n\nToday’s bipartisan ratification of the Kigali Amendment strengthens America’s global competitiveness and climate leadership. It will reduce our dependence on foreign imports from China, further protect our planet, and create jobs that strengthen our economy.\n\nI had a fantastic few weeks traveling Colorado to discuss our state's priorities and the progress Congress has made — from the #InflationReductionAct to the CHIPS bill to the PACT Act. As I head back to Washington this week, I look forward to carrying Colorado's ideas with me. \n\nBetween expanding veterans' health care and bringing chips manufacturing jobs home, we’ve made real bipartisan progress in Washington. Last week, I stopped by Colorado Springs to hear about the effect these historic bills will have in Colorado. \n\nThere's a lot of cynicism about Congress, and trust me I get it. But this year of big achievements — on infrastructure, gun safety, veterans’ health care, chips, climate, drug prices, and deficit reduction — should remind us that our voices matter. Change is possible.\n\nIt includes 3 of my bills to boost US manufacturing for wind &amp; solar energy components, along with next-generation batteries to power electric vehicles and our energy grid to create good-paying jobs &amp; reduce our dependence on foreign imports from nations like China. ☀ (7\/12)\n\nAccording to Colorado's own @RockyMtnInst, the combination of the infrastructure bill, the CHIPS bill and the Inflation Reduction Act will TRIPLE federal investment in climate and clean energy over the last decade. This is what progress looks like. \n\nToday I visited @MicrochipTech in Colorado Springs to learn how the bipartisan competition bill signed into law this week could help quadruple their production of American-made chips to support our defense and energy industries and create good-paying jobs. \n\n🚨 @POTUS just signed our bipartisan CHIPS Act into law to lower costs for families, strengthen supply chains, and boost U.S. tech competitiveness. Between this historic bill and the Inflation Reduction Act, it's an amazing moment for our country.\n\nLast month, the Senate passed the CHIPS Act to drive down prices. Just this week, we passed the PACT Act for our veterans. Now, we're close to passing the Inflation Reduction Act to lower health care costs &amp; put us on the path to energy independence. This is an amazing moment. \n\nChina’s dominance in 5G is a threat to U.S. economic and national security. We passed funding this week for my bill with @MarkWarner and @SenRubioPress to invest in a secure U.S. approach to 5G.\n\nThe shortage of semiconductor chips has driven up prices and shrunk inventories of everything from cars to computers to home appliances. The Senate needs to urgently pass funding so we can make the semiconductors we need here in America once again.\n\nAs a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, I've repeatedly warned that we risk losing the tech race to China unless we start thinking ahead. Finally, we're close to passing a historic investment in key technologies like 5G, AI &amp; quantum to strengthen U.S. competitiveness.\n\nToday we are dangerously reliant on foreign manufacturers for advanced semiconductors — the chips needed for our smartphones, cars, and farm equipment. We need to pass the emergency chips funding so we can make these semiconductors in America &amp; strengthen our national security.\n\nAmerica's security &amp; prosperity hinge on our technology leadership. But we have no idea where we stand vs. competitors like China. My bill with @BenSasse &amp; @MarkWarner will give us a clear picture of where America leads and lags, so we can secure our edge.\n\nThere’s no other country for which immigration is so central to its identity. People aren’t lining up to go to Russia or China. They want to come to America. That should fill us with pride. We can build an immigration system that honors our heritage AND upholds the rule of law.\n\nWe don’t have to choose between letting digital platforms write their own rules, allowing competitors like China and the E.U. write those rules, or leaving it to politicians in Congress.\n\nWe cannot let China eclipse American leadership in emerging technologies like AI and quantum. We need a national strategy to invest in key technologies and work with allies to protect critical supply chains and advance global tech standards that reflect our values.\n\nSpace is an increasingly critical and contested domain that is central to our 21st century economy, communications, and security. We face threats from Russia and China's rapidly developing space capabilities, and it's imperative that we act to secure America's leadership. \n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

America can and must re-take the lead. \n\nIt was great to join #RSC members to advocate for my legislation—the Countering Atrocities through Currency Accountability Act. Thank you to @RepJimBanks &amp; @EnesFreedom for your support. It is imperative the U.S. uses our influence to counter China’s genocide in Xinjiang. \n\nRemoving tariffs on China will make the United States more dependent on China.\n\nBig Tech likes to pretend they’re “national champions.” The only thing they’re national champions of is kowtowing to the Chinese Communist Party. \n\nIt’s ironic to me that while China accuses America of being racist, the CCP is labeling an entire ethnic group “terrorists” and trying to wipe them off the face of the earth. \n\nChina is on Russia’s team.\n\nThose *free* COVID tests came from China.\n\nPres.

READ our letter here: \n\nAs the leader of the free world, Pres. Biden has FAILED to take the necessary steps to ensure our Olympic athletes are not punished for speaking against China’s human rights violations. \n\nNot too long ago Speaker Pelosi supported NFL athletes’ anthem protests, yet today she tells U.S. Olympic athletes to not protest China’s human rights violations. This is what the policy of appeasement looks like. \n\nThere is grave concern for Olympic athletes' safety in China. That’s why I am calling on Pres. Biden to take steps to ensure our athletes are secure from arbitrary retribution. Read my full statement  \n\nThe free world is under attack by China. Every freedom-loving country has a responsibility to protect the rights and liberties at the foundation to our prosperity. \n\nMultilateral organizations like the UN and WHO utterly fail to advance peace and prosperity. Instead, they act as puppets of authoritarians like China. \n\nChina continues to exploit the US’ porous southern border to traffic fentanyl to the United States through Mexico, but the Biden administration continues to promote policies to weaken our national security. \n\nChina: forcefully sterilizes Uyghurs. Also China: increases fertility treatments for its other citizens. \n\nFacebook and Twitter banned the sitting American President. Why doesn’t either company have an issue with the Chinese government running propaganda campaigns on their platform to cover up its genocide in Xinjiang? \n\nWas proud to support this letter with my fellow House Republicans, demanding answers regarding Apple’s censorship in China. \n\nThe Chinese government is aggressively campaigning to undermine the Taiwanese people’s right to self-determination. I continue to support Taiwan and oppose the CCP’s influence campaigns. \n\nChina is hunting down Taiwanese people living abroad to have them extradited back to the mainland, where they are at high risk of human rights abuses. If these individuals have committed crimes, they should be returned to Taiwan, not to mainland. \n\nHats off to @EnesFreedom for standing firm on his outspoken stance against Communist China, as many of his NBA colleagues continue to operate under a double standard -- standing mute against the atrocities committed by the CCP. \n\nPresident Xi Jinping directly authorized China’s genocidal campaign to eradicate Uyghurs and other ethnic minorities. What happened to “never again”? \n\n.@USTreasury should investigate Airbnb for noncompliance with US sanctions law. Airbnb is a sponsor of the Beijing Olympics in February and they clearly have no issue with China's genocide and human rights abuses in Xinjiang.

The astounding expansion of China’s nuclear arsenal should motivate robust investments in our own nuclear capabilities. \n\nClassification is a barrier to our national security. It stops us from talking internally about capability &amp; integration, and blocks us from being able to create successful relationships with allies to deter nations like China &amp; Russia from harmful ideas. \n\nBiden’s NPR details the serious threat posed by China &amp; Russia’s nuclear buildups, but cancels SLCM-N with little justification. Pointing at a problem won't deter it. That’s why House &amp; Senate NDAAs continue funding for SLCM-N, and I will continue to advocate for this program.\n\nSpace is fundamental to our way of life, and China and Russia intend to make it a warzone. A future war in space won’t look like the movies, but we have to prepare for terrestrial wars to extend into space. #SpaceSaturday \n\nRussian and Chinese strategists view U.S. reliance on space as both our strategic advantage and Achilles heel. We cannot let the fate of our nation be weakened by soft space policies. We must lead in space, and we must project strength against strength. \n\nWe must continue to address this grave threat as China continues to enhance their space program. The United States cannot allow for our space systems to be threatened. #SpaceSaturday \n\nWe cannot take anymore of the Democrats' reckless spending policies. Republican's #CommitmentToAmerica will ensure we have an economy that's strong by:  Curbing wasteful government spending  Moving supply chains away from China  Expanding U.S. manufacturing \n\nChina continues to close the technological advantages the U.S holds. We must outpace our adversaries in maintaining our space superiority. \n\nAs Putin continues to push his propaganda through a sham referendum in Ukraine and Biden remains lost and confused on China, it is imperative that America’s strength and resolve is clearly conveyed to our adversaries. This is our #CommitmentToAmerica \n\n With adversaries such as China continuing to enhance their capabilities, it is imperative that the U.S. maintains our space superiority.\n\nJoe Biden decided to postpone yet another routine ICBM test. This time, to appease Xi as China conducts belligerent military operations due to Pelosi’s Taiwan visit. \n\nGlad to join @michaelgwaltz in demanding @SecDef reconsider the military's COVID-19 vaccine mandate. While China is embarking on a massive military buildup which threatens American interests, we should not be hindering our own readiness by forcing out dedicated servicemembers. \n\nAs Russia and China continue to enhance their anti-satellite capabilities, the Biden Administration has unilaterally and unnecessarily banned U.S. ASAT tests. In the fight for space superiority, Biden has chosen vulnerability. \n\nRussia and China pose a real threat to the U.S. in space. It’s time the Biden Administration takes this seriously. We must lead. \n\nA commitment to not conduct ASAT tests creates a false equivalence between our carefully calibrated behavior in space and the reckless actions of China &amp; Russia. This move does nothing to deter our adversaries in an escalating space warfighting domain. \n\nOnly China and Russia are reassured by Biden’s defense budget request, which does not even attempt to keep pace with the inflation his reckless spending has caused. I look forward to working with @HASCRepublicans on a defense budget that achieves real growth for our warfighters.\n\nOne of the biggest allies of the #CCP is House Democrats. Their \"China\" bill contains $8 billion for the green climate fund and $6 million for coral reef management. Notably absent: protections of American IP and accountability for #Covid19. This legislation is unserious.\n\nThis decision is a massive win for our servicemembers and will ensure our military readiness remains steadfast with growing threats from Russia and China. I will continue working to halt this unconstitutional mandate and protect the First Amendment rights of ALL Americans. \n\nTaiwan is a sovereign nation. The #CCP should not flippantly threaten American troops. I will continue to ensure the Taiwanese have the tools they need to defend themselves. \n\nThread: I was pleased to vote for the #NDAA, which will benefit CO-05 due to its emphasis on space, missile defense, and new defense technologies. The FY22 NDAA will be essential in maintaining our competitive advantage over adversaries like Russia and China.\n\nAmerica's adversaries have been emboldened under Joe Biden: ▪ Russia is massing troops on the Ukrainian border ▪ #CCP is threatening Taiwan's sovereignty &amp; committing genocide ▪ Taliban takeover of Afghanistan ▪ Iran is re-nuclearizing ▪ North Korea is testing new missiles\n\nThe United States must always stand with @iingwen and the people of Taiwan against the aggressive actions of the #CCP.\n\nThe #CCP is continuing to develop its clandestine space capabilities to threaten our national security. Although China claims that these satellites are for peaceful purposes, it is clear they have a military application. #SpaceSaturday \n\nChina's missile test is another massive intelligence failure. This is a modern Sputnik moment. We must invest NOW to modernize &amp; grow the capacity of our forces to show strength &amp; deter threats from the #CCP. Biden's appeasement foreign policy approach is a deadly disaster.\n\nJoe Biden’s speech at the #UNGA today failed to mention Russia, China, or the #CCP even one time. He capitulates to our adversaries and refuses to hold them accountable. #UNGA76\n\nBreaking 🚨 Democrats just voted against @HawleyMO's legislation which would declassify all intelligence surrounding the origin of COVID-19 and the #CCP's Wuhan Institute of Virology.

As the Chinese people bravely protest these draconian policies, Democrats have turned their backs. @HouseGOP will not ignore the abuses happening in China.\n\nWe cannot allow the Chinese to take over America’s agricultural resources.\n\nAccording to the IEA, China controls approximately 90% of global rare earth mineral refining capabilities. This is a major threat to American security. Mining and refining these resources here in the United States is the responsible, ethical, and forward-thinking solution.\n\nRepublicans are committed to building an economy that’s strong. We will cut wasteful government spending, reduce reliance on hostile foreign countries, and move American supply chains away from China.\n\nAmerica’s fentanyl crisis has gotten so bad that some law enforcement officers have begun to describe it as the “tsunami of death.” Cheap Chinese fentanyl coming across the southern border kills nearly 200 Americans a DAY. \n\nWe are far too reliant on Chinese critical minerals for key industries of the American economy. This is a matter of national security. We need to source these materials here at home.\n\nThis is the fifth time President Biden has jeopardized our national security by selling off our strategic petroleum reserves.

For instance, China has already created a CBDC that can be used to spy on citizens and marginalize political dissidents.\n\nFood security is national security. We cannot allow foreign adversaries to weaken our ability to feed our own citizens. Last week, I joined @jdtcnt to discuss our work to prevent China from buying up American farmland. \n\nI am proud to cosponsor @RepNewhouse’s bill to prohibit China from buying American farmland. More from @RiponAdvance here: \n\nChina’s American agricultural land holdings have increased tenfold in the last decade. Food Security is national security; we cannot allow foreign adversaries to weaken our domestic food production.\n\nMinnesota is the largest producer of iron ore and taconite in the United States. We can either mine critical minerals safely and responsibly here in the U.S., or we can remain reliant on countries like China and Russia. \n\nOpen. Permissionless. Private.

America remains the last best hope for man on earth and the Biden-Harris Administration’s silence is a very poor example for those who yearn for their freedom.\n\nThe @HouseGOP #CommitmentToAmerica starts with an economy that's strong. From securing our supply chains &amp; ending our reliance on China to restoring energy independence &amp; lowering gas prices, we stand united in our commitment to bettering the lives of every American.\n\nFor too long, America has been reliant on foreign countries like China, Russia, &amp; the Congo in our mineral supply chains. However, we are blessed with vast mineral wealth &amp; a world class workforce. Let’s mine, process, &amp; manufacture here at home, with high-wage high-quality jobs. \n\nI just testified in front of the International Trade Commission in support of making our steel right here in the United States, as well as anti-steel dumping rules. #MN08 workers and miners should be put first, not Russia and China! \n\nICYMI: I joined @news_ntd to discuss U.S. dependency on Communist China for rare earths &amp; critical minerals. It's time to secure our supply chain, empower American workers &amp; end our reliance on foreign adversaries for minerals! \n\nIt’s unfortunate the Biden Admin put their dependency for both critical minerals &amp; rare earths in the hands of communist China. It’s simply unacceptable when we have the critical minerals &amp; a few of the rare earths right here in the US. \n\nAs mineral demand rises, the Biden Admin &amp; House Democrats are moving to ban domestic mining projects, including in northern Minnesota, which would make the U.S. more dependent on foreign adversaries like China for minerals. Instead, we need to restore American mineral dominance. \n\nI joined @TeamCavuto on @FoxBusiness today to discuss Biden's rollback of solar panel tariffs on China and the importance of Minnesota's mineral wealth to our domestic supply chains. Watch here  \n\nIt's simple: Biden and his Administration need to choose Minnesota union labor over Communist China. That's why I’m demanding he keep steel tariffs in place. Read more from @RiponAdvance below \n\nI sent a letter to Pres. Biden demanding his Admin keep tariffs on steel from Communist China following discussion that they are potentially considering lifting tariffs. Keeping the steel tariffs would support Minnesota workers &amp; families by protecting our taconite industry. \n\nBiden’s move to waive tariffs on solar panel imports won’t ease energy prices for Americans but does hand a win to Communist China. Instead, we should develop American resources using American workers. Read more from me &amp; @RepGallagher \n\nWhen Biden says “climate” I think of how he chooses Chinese solar panels made with slave labor and no environmental protection while he tries to ban clean, domestic mining in my district. \n\nLet me be clear: rolling back solar tariffs is not only a favor to communist China, it means we're turning our backs on ready &amp; able American workers. The Biden Administration has chosen to support everyone and everything BUT the American workforce. Support domestic production! \n\nProud to join @RepTiffany in demanding the US withdraw from the World Health Organization. The WHO’s deference to the Chinese Communist Party shows they cannot be trusted. \n\nThe so-called \"Clean Energy Minerals Reform Act\" will make it even harder to access clean energy minerals domestically while furthering our reliance on Russia, China, and the Congo. Instead, we must encourage domestic mining. Read my op-ed here  \n\n\"Thirty years ago, the U.S. was the world’s number one producer of minerals. Today, it’s China. We could easily return to first place if only we cut through our mountains of red tape.\" @exjon is right. \n\nMy friend @RepJerryCarl is right: \"Now is the time for the Biden administration to put America first by empowering American workers to unleash our mineral resources and end our dependence on China.\" \n\nCriminal drug networks in Mexico, with resources from China, are trafficking enough fentanyl over the southern border to kill the American people 7 times over. That's why I spoke on the House floor about Biden's fentanyl crisis. Watch below: \n\nI voted against the Democrats’ America Concedes Act. Rather than being tough on Communist China, it emboldens their leadership and rewards bad behavior. Instead, we need a tough bipartisan bill to address the Chinese Communist Party’s harmful practices. \n\nBut sourced in China. \n\nInstead of relying on adversarial nations like China for our battery supply chains, we should incentivize processing and manufacturing plants here in the US. My Manufacturing America’s Mineral Security Act would do just that. @WSJ \n\nHunter Biden’s firm helped a Chinese company purchase a cobalt mine in 2016, the same year Joe Biden originally moved to ban cobalt mining in #MN08 as VP. And he’s trying to do it again now. This corruption must be investigated. We must use American miners, not fund the CCP!\n\n(2\/2) Demand for these critical minerals will only increase, but instead of empowering Minnesota’s miners to responsibly develop these resources, Biden would rather keep us dependent on China.\n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

If GOP want to follow through on tackling inflation, the border crisis, China, &amp; investigations, we need to lead, put aside differences, &amp; get to work on day 1.\n\nI joined @MasonMornings to discuss the threat China poses to our national security—from buying American farmland and ag processing facilities, collecting sensitive data through TikTok, and the CCP using its power to influence corporate and political relations. Listen here: \n\nOne part of @Apple's recent update limits AirDrop capabilities for anyone in China. It’s aiding the CCP’s censorship of speech and stifling pro-democracy protests. I’m looking for answers. I sent a letter to @tim_cook questioning his decision to rollout this limited feature. \n\n.@Apple - this update directly aids the CCP in their authoritarian quest to stifle peaceful protests and keep their people in COVID lockdowns. What's the deal? We should add this to our list of investigations for next Congress' Select Committee on China. \n\nThis is great news. I’ve been leading legislation to do this at the federal level, too. China and TikTok pose a real threat to national security. It’s great to see momentum growing from other leaders to #BlockTheTok. \n\nWe need to expand U.S. manufacturing and decrease our economic reliance on China. Their control over portions of our supply chain is an economic &amp; national security threat. We need to focus on policies that boost our economic competitiveness and stability. #CommitmentToAmerica\n\nTikTok delivers garbage content to American students and educational content to Chinese students. We cannot trust this company. \n\nTikTok’s China-based parent company ByteDance has planned to use the TikTok app to track the physical location of American citizens. We need to #BlockTheTok to stop this and make sure the CCP can’t access sensitive U.S. national security data. \n\nContrary to sworn testimony, a leaked report shows Americans' data was accessed in China, creating potential for sensitive U.S. national security information to be accessed. My #BlocktheTok Act would eliminate this concern. \n\nChina is not our friend. I recently sent a letter requesting Secretaries Vilsack, Yellen, and Austin to investigate how China's ownership of American agriculture land near an Air Force base. We need to understand the threat China's actions have on our national security.\n\nControl of our food supply does not belong in the hands of our adversaries--especially China. Congress needs to pass the PASS Act to protect our food and supply chain. We have got to prioritize national security concerns when it comes to agriculture. \n\nVoiceprints collected from TikTok may be used by China to increase their national advantage. My #BlocktheTok Act would eliminate the risk of national security conversations being recorded on military installations and federal agencies. \n\nChina’s ownership of TikTok is a national security threat. I introduced the Block the Tok Act to prohibit China’s access to the personal data of TikTok users and the download of the app on government and military devices. \n\nI introduced the Block the Tok Act to prohibit TikTok from accessing user data of Americans from within China, investigate whether TikTok is engaging in unfair or deceptive practices, and prohibit TikTok on military installations and on government devices. \n\nChina’s ownership of the TikTok app has given China access to an unprecedented amount of American’s personal data—including voice and facial data. This is a national security concern.\n\nChina’s ownership of foreign farmland and ag processing has increased tenfold in the last ten years. This is a real problem. Food security is national security. I talked with Fox News this morning about my bills to stop this. \n\nChinese companies have been purchasing more and more U.S. farmland. Allowing this to continue could lead to serious food and national security concerns. I introduced a bill to stop purchases like this from our adversaries. Check out my interview below. \n\nI introduced the PASS Act to blacklist countries like China and Russia from purchasing agriculture companies in America. Read more: \n\nConsumer spending on e-commerce hit record numbers last year. China began incentivizing foreign ocean carriers to drop their loads at the dock, ditch American food exports, and return to Asia w\/empty containers. We heard from U.S. biz in March 2021 about this unfair behavior.\n\nThe bill passed in the House today does not do enough to hold China accountable. In fact, it includes the word “coral reefs” more often than the word “China.” We need to pass a bill that actually focuses on American competitiveness.\n\nOur supply chain needs reform. American goods are stuck at port with nowhere to go while China ships back empty containers. The Ocean Shipping Reform Act updates our maritime laws and puts American goods on a level playing field with foreign ocean carriers. Learn more \n\nDuring a @TransportGOP hearing on shipping container shortages &amp; delays with our supply chain, I spoke with @NPPC President Jen Sorenson. Unreliable shipping hurts American pork producers and forces countries like China to look elsewhere for suppliers. \n\nToday I formally requested Speaker Pelosi authorize an investigation into where COVID-19 specifically came from. We can’t trust investigations led by the Chinese government and the WHO. Americans deserve answers. \n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

More here: \n\nTaiwan is the 10th largest trading partner of the U.S. and a good friend of our country. I joined a bipartisan letter encouraging U.S. Trade Representative, Ambassador Katherine Tai, to reconvene free trade agreement talks with Taiwan. \n\nRussia and Communist China are not acting as our friends.

Any discussions between @POTUS and China should address this serious issue. \n\nThe Chinese Communist Party may have stolen the personal data of 80% of American adults. This should concern us all.

It’s time the U.S. did the same. \n\nThe FY23 NDAA grows the @USNavy, which is key in the face of China’s rapid expansion and ensures the @DeptofDefense has the power and infrastructure to maximize readiness and lethality — now and in the future.\n\nChina’s growing investment in American farmland poses a serious national security threat. Farms are the heart of our local communities, and it is my priority to ensure Alabama’s food security and family farmers are not uprooted by foreign investments. \n\nA truth-teller in Washington is as rare as a three-eyed mule—and gets about the same treatment. America owes a debt to Admiral Charles Richard for warning of China’s breathtaking nuclear rise. We need more leaders like him.\n\nAmerica leads the world in financial innovation. But, without responsible cryptocurrency regulation, we will fall behind competitors like China. \n\nIt’s unacceptable to invest our military’s retirement savings in corrupt firms that enable the CCP and finance the Chinese military. I introduced a bill to put a stop to this. \n\nWe must mitigate Chinese influence in America. Read more about my latest efforts to protect our national security: \n\nI wish the Taiwanese people a Happy Taiwan National Day as they celebrate their right to live in a free and democratic society. \n\nIt’s bad enough we’ve ceded America’s manufacturing base to China, now we’re supplying the Chinese with a vast information database on our shipping. \n\nChina isn’t buying vacation houses—they’re after strategic American property. \n\nChina is playing live target practice with Taiwan while the Biden admin spends ~$3M to delay critical ICBM tests. \n\nThe Chinese Communist Party is buying thousands of acres across the U.S., giving them a foothold in our economy and ag industry. We can't let that happen. @DailySignal \n\n.@FoxBusiness: China is doing 'everything they can' to outrun America in nuclear weapons WATCH: \n\nChinese-owned trading platforms are giving the #CCP access to YOUR data. It's a huge national security threat, and it’s time we stopped it. I joined @FoxBusiness to discuss  \n\nGlad to see our allies condemning Chinese aggression. \n\nThe People's Republic of China rejects international norms and the rule of law. Americans need to wake up to the CCP's increasing belligerence. \n\nWhen the U.S. allows the CCP to purchase our land, we undermine our national security &amp; put our future food supply chain at risk. That's why @SenTomCotton &amp; I introduced a bill to protect our farmers and combat China's influence in U.S. agriculture. \n\nThe Dems’ tax hike discourages U.S. manufacturing when we should be bending over backwards to increase America’s manufacturing capability and reducing our reliance on Communist China. I hope @SenateDems will realize this is a HUGE mistake.\n\nWho does the Dems' tax package help? China. Dems' tax hike on U.S. manufacturers will drive industry overseas. That plays right into China's hands.\n\nThe SEC's recent climate disclosure proposal does nothing to protect investors. I'm urging the SEC to fully implement the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act and ensure they are not putting U.S. investors at risk by using broker-dealers owned by Chinese companies.\n\nOur nation faces all kinds of national security issues—China, Russia, Iran, North Korea, terrorists. The #FY23NDAA can't wait on the politics. Call the vote, @SenSchumer.\n\nIt’s time for @SenSchumer to bring the #FY23NDAA to the floor, so our @USNavy can remain competitive with China’s Navy. \n\nIf @POTUS is concerned with the climate, then he shouldn’t lift our tariffs on Chinese imports. \n\nGreat to see our friends from Taiwan in Alabama. \n\nLong story short, the risk of doing business in China is about to get much higher. \n\nTaking it easy on China won't resolve record-high inflation when you keep recklessly spending money. \n\nWith rising Chinese &amp; Russian aggression, strategic investments in our national defense has never been more important. We kept this in mind when crafting the FY23 NDAA, fighting to fund cybersecurity programs &amp; infrastructure in our military.  \n\n33 years after the #TiananmenSquareMassacre, the CCP continues its efforts to crack down on fundamental rights. Today, we must remember the lives lost and recommit ourselves to standing up for freedom and human rights in China. \n\nI received confirmation from the Biden admin that they would uphold the Trump-era commitment to prohibit TSP investment in Chinese securities. \n\n$700 billion dollars in retirement investment from our nation’s military and federal civilian workforce should not be used to prop up China-based companies. \n\nInvesting in Chinese companies is a risk to our national security &amp; millions of federal employees' finances. I'm glad the Biden admin has finally agreed w\/@SenTomCotton, @SenRubioPress, &amp; me—federal retirement plans shouldn't include Chinese companies. \n\nEvery Chinese company is an extension of the Chinese Communist Party. A new report shows how the Chinese government is undermining American businesses by subsidizing failing industries. \n\nMoving. These images from China's Uyghur detention camps further expose the heartbreaking reality that the CCP is holding thousands against their will for merely exercising their faith. \n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

China can now hold that over us. This is unacceptable if we wish to remain a leader in trade and national security. \n\nThanks to @NASA_Johnson for the great welcome at Mission Control Houston. We have got to put a greater emphasis on remaining the world’s leader in space. We cannot let the Chinese overtake us. \n\nI have been a staunch believer in the notion that the U.S. is engaged in a new era space race. We need to prioritize new resources and leverage national assets to ensure China does not achieve the space superiority they so desperately desire. \n\nIf the Chinese Communist Party’s ambitions to replace the United States as the global superpower are left unchecked, they will not stop at Xinjiang. The Chinese must be held accountable. \n\nChina’s rogue rocket and lack of exercising basic safety standards in space, only further proves that they are incapable of leading. The US must continue to lead by example and curtail this type of ignorant behavior. \n\nChina has an agenda in space, and we cannot allow ourselves to fall behind. The double standard here is just another example of how they refuse to acknowledge the lunar superiority they so badly desire and attack us for wanting to defend ourselves. \n\nIf we are to defend our way of life, we must stay focused on the threats before us. From comments like these, it’s clear the Chinese are at the top of the list of our adversaries. \n\nAs I’ve said before, relying on China and our adversaries for minerals critical to our industrial base is a ticking time bomb. We have to aggressively address this issue. \n\nI asked Administrator @SenBillNelson with @NASA about securing American research and development within the space industrial base. Evidently China didn’t like his answer. Its past time to expose China’s theft of American research and technology. \n\nI asked @SecRaimondo about our import reliance for critical minerals. “Vulnerable” is not a word that should be used to describe our standing with China on any issue. It’s time to work towards domestic production and trade with allies, not adversaries. \n\nI'm calling on us make new investments in our military to meet the challenges we have coming at us from Russia, China, North Korea and Iran. China in particular wants to match, and surpass us in military capability by the middle of the century. \n\nWhile we seek for space to be a peaceful domain, it would be naive to assume that Russia and China will do the same. Our adversaries will surely continue these tests and our national security will be at a heightened risk because of it. \n\nThis would be hilarious if it wasn't so scary and troubling. Russia, nor China, have democracy or the world's best interests at heart. They want all people to live under autocracy. @CBSNews \n\nSince 2017 we have moved to 100% reliability on China and other countries for 14 of 35 critical minerals necessary for the defense industrial base. We cannot continue to rely on adversaries for the materials that we need for our defense. \n\nThis is a growing problem. How China's TikTok, Facebook influencers push propaganda (from @AP) \n\nWe can not afford to wait for China to act to strengthen our forces and relationships with our allies. Ensuring a strong defense budget year after year allows us to stay ahead of our adversaries. \n\nI fully support our efforts to help the people of Ukraine. But I'm disappointed the President did not address our own defense needs with increased spending to address the new threats from Russia and China.\n\nI agree we need to stop relying on Chinese made goods. This also goes for our military equipment. It should all be sourced\/made in the U.S. or in our allied countries.\n\nI’m glad the Biden Administration finally decided to make this obvious choice. With China’s recent human rights abuses, theft of intellectual property, &amp; their lack of COVID openness, I don’t think the CCP should be celebrated on the world stage. \n\nChina’s Communist Party is determined to destroy democracy and freedom. They’re actively tearing down #HongKong and are continuing their aggression towards Taiwan. We must hold the CCP accountable on the world stage and stand by the freedom-loving people of Taiwan. \n\nChina’s communist power grab in Hong Kong is reaching new heights. As a nation founded on the ideas of liberty and freedom, the U.S. must firmly stand against the CCP’s authoritarian overreach and support #HongKong as they fight for freedom. \n\nDefending our nation should always be priority number one. We cannot let our military capabilities fall behind the likes of China and Russia, and that’s why bolstering the budget for national defense is so crucial. Now is the time for strength, not weakness. \n\nEnsuring the U.S. does not use taxpayer dollars to fund international abortion is just common sense. Especially when that money would be funneled to the brutal communist regime in China. I am unapologetically Pro-Life, and I will always fight for life &amp; fight against the CCP. \n\nFor 100 years the CCP has brutally violated human rights, persecuted Christians, starved its own people, and propagated lies. They attack neighbors like Taiwan &amp; suppress freedom in Hong Kong. A century of CCP rule is nothing to celebrate. It's a dark milestone in history. \n\nHundreds of children in China are waiting for their forever home, but the Chinese government has halted the adoption process with families in the U.S. I join my colleagues in calling on @SecBlinken to engage with Beijing to ensure adoptive families are united once and for all. \n\nChina's lies and deception about the Coronavirus led to a global pandemic. We cannot continue to listen to their propaganda. Congress must get answers for the American people on how COVID-19 originated. It's time to investigate the Wuhan lab. \n\n\"No responsible American president can remain silent when basic human rights are violated.\" What about the genocide being committed by the Chinese Communist government against its own people?\n\nChina’s communist regime has worked relentlessly to isolate Taiwan from the global community. The @WHO cannot bend the knee to Beijing and let their influence dictate global affairs. We must #LetTaiwanHelp and ensure Taiwan’s full participation at the World Health Assembly.\n\nThe CCP is blatantly violating human rights in Xinjiang. There is no question about it. For China to claim this fact as just “lies and false information” is outrageous – this is nothing more than government-sanctioned hypocrisy coming out of Beijing. \n\nThe Chinese Communist Party will stop at nothing to dismantle democracy in Hong Kong. They are now quite literally writing the book on it. As a country built on the ideals of democracy and freedom, we must #StandWithHongKong \n\nThat is why I am a proud cosponsor of the H.Res. 59, which expresses the sense of Congress that the United States should not be a party to this agreement until China and others are held to these strict standards.\n\nRejoining the Paris Climate Agreement will not only hurt Alabamians in the pocketbook but fails to hold some of the largest polluters accountable, specifically #China.\n\nI'm glad to see @SecPompeo make this determination. The Chinese Communist government, as almost all communist governments do, have forced harsh penalties, including death, on people simply trying to practice their religion in peace.\n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

How much do you want to bet that Biden fails to bring it up? Biden has shown weakness at every turn when dealing with America's foes. \n\nICYMI: I held a telephone town hall last night. More than 3,000 5th District residents joined, and I got a lot of great questions. A gentleman asked me about Communist Chinese aggression and America’s response. Listen to my answer. \n\nCommunist China is not our friend. They hate our freedom, and they aim to overtake America as the world’s only superpower. They seek to use espionage and lies to bring America down. We must remain vigilant as we counter the dictatorial Communist Chinese. \n\nI'm cosponsoring @RepGallagher's HR 4361, which would bar individuals affiliated w\/ the Chinese military from acquiring US student or work-and-study exchange visas. China isn’t our friend, &amp; we shouldn’t educate the next generation of CCP military minds at American Universities.\n\nWe know COVID-19 originated at the Communist Chinese Wuhan Institute of Virology. What we don't know is whether it was released negligently, recklessly, or intentionally as part of a military experiment. Either way, China must atone for its wrongdoing. \n\nI am cosponsoring @RepHartzler's HR 4821, which would hold accountable senior officials of the Government of the People's Republic of China who are responsible for, complicit in, or have directly persecuted Christians in China. I won't stand for the CCP targeting people of faith.\n\nThe EB-5 program is fraught with abuse. It is nothing more than a citizenship buying program used overwhelmingly by wealthy and well-connected Chinese nationals. \n\nI urge America and the world to wake up to the threat posed by an unchecked Chinese Communist Party. It’s time to get tough and hold China accountable for its deadly actions.\n\nDr. Li-Meng Yan bravely defected from China to America after DISCOVERING the COMMUNIST CHINESE PARTY’S destructive and evil Wuhan bio-weapons program.\n\nThe evidence is overwhelming that the Communist Chinese Party NEGLIGENTLY, RECKLESSLY OR INTENTIONALLY RELEASED COVID-19 on the world. Moreover, China engaged in a massive disinformation and propaganda campaign to cover up their misdeeds. \n\nChina lied about COVID-19, and those lies killed Americans. Communist China must atone for its wrongdoing by compensating America and Americans for losses suffered as a result of COVID-19.

This bill establishes that China is responsible for COVID-19, lied &amp; covered it up, &amp; requires China to pay restitution to American families and businesses. \n\nMy bill, the China COVID-19 Restitution Act, holds Communist China accountable for their horrific actions and compensates American citizens and governments for the losses suffered at the hands of Communist China.\n\nNot only did China lie about COVID-19 origins, China also lied about and covered up both the contagiousness and lethality of COVID-19 (while still allowing international travel and thus exporting a global pandemic). China’s lies killed.\n\nRegardless of whether China’s conduct was negligent, reckless or intentional, China knowingly created COVID-19 in the Wuhan Institute of Virology without implementing the necessary containment measures needed to prevent COVID-19 from circling the globe and killing millions.\n\nCommunist China must atone for its wrongdoing by compensating America and Americans for losses suffered as a result of COVID-19. \n\nHolding the Chinese Communist Party accountable for COVID-19 does not equate to generating anti-Asian hatred. For the fake news media to suggest that’s the case demonstrates their clear liberal bias and false equivalence. I will not stand for it. \n\nI joined @newsmax &amp; @gregkellyusa to discuss @ericswalwell's lackey serving my WIFE with his frivolous lawsuit. Swalwell could have been a man and served me himself in Washington, but he's too busy dodging questions about him bedding a Communist Chinese Spy.

We discussed the importance of reducing inflation and ending our dependence on Chinese supply chains. Thank you for having me. #AL06 \n\nThis $280 billion unpaid-for bill was a wasted opportunity to combat aggression by the Chinese Communist Party and ignores the record levels of inflation American families are facing. \n\nListen here to my conversation this morning on @MasonMornings about energy policy, Russia's war on Ukraine, China, and more: \n\nI’m live now on @FRCdc’s Washington Watch to talk Ukraine, Russia, and China.

More of my thoughts on this here: GOP Rep. Palmer: China’s Intent Is to Make Russia a Vassal State \n\nICYMI: I joined Julie Mason on @SXMPOTUS this week to discuss growing concerns over inflation and rising consumer prices, Russia and China's increasing power on the world stage, and more. Catch the conversation here: \n\nSpeaker Pelosi called the Chinese government \"ruthless\" and warned our athletes not to risk thinking it has \"any good intentions.\" So why are she and fellow Democrats touting a bill that ignores the CCP's ongoing human rights abuses? \n\nA few key facts on the bill: -Prioritizes leftist climate agenda items -Includes nothing to hold China accountable for its genocide of Uyghurs or cover-up of COVID -Gives unions advantages over small businesses -Adds $8 billion to a UN slush fund that already benefits China\n\nDemocrats in Congress actually seem willing to help them toward that goal with their new America Competes Act (HR 4521). It could be named the #AmericaConcedes Act, as it would benefit the CCP and surrender America’s global competitive advantage to China.\n\nOur country’s security has weakened in all areas during the Biden Administration, from dependence on Russian energy to a porous southern border. The Administration also refuses to acknowledge that China is a dangerous enemy with the goal of world domination.\n\nThe Chinese Communist government is clearly emboldened by the weak leadership of President Biden. The President must make it clear we stand with our allies and this type of aggressive behavior will not be tolerated by the United States. \n\nNow is the time to lead from strength, especially when dealing with China and investigating the #COVID19 outbreak origins. The Chinese government must be held accountable. They will only exploit President Biden's show of weakness. \n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

He is strongly pro-American and has vast knowledge about China, its leaders, and the Chinese Communist Party’s aggressive plans to confront the United States and its key allies, like Australia. [1\/2] \n\nShould America &amp; the world stand by as China crushes Taiwan, that would not simply undermine the security of the Western Pacific, it would undermine America’s role in the world and the values it has infused into it. If America does not lead, our enemies will. #AEIFDP 🧵 \n\nThe third layer of deterrence would employ American power beyond our military to deter a #CCP invasion. My STAND with #Taiwan would put the CCP on notice that no corner of its economy will be left untouched by sanctions—from finance to trade to industry.#AEIFDP🧵 \n\nNo one in America wants a war in the #Taiwan Strait. If one is launched, the U.S. won’t be the aggressor. So, enhancing deterrence should be a top priority of U.S. policy. #AEIFDP 🧵 \n\nA #CCP takeover of #Taiwan would be a global boost to the model of authoritarian governance Xi offers the world. In a world order built on #CCP power and values, freedom would be unsafe everywhere—including in the United States. #AEIFDP 🧵\n\nA #CCP takeover of #Taiwan could also call into question U.S. commitments to our Pacific allies and cause some countries to build up their own military capabilities, including nuclear deterrence; or choose an accommodating posture toward their aggressive neighbor. #AEIFDP 🧵\n\nWhat is #Taiwan looking at across the Strait?  \n\nLast year before #SFRC, .@ASD_IndoPacific Dr. Ratner testified #Taiwan is “a critical node within the first island chain…(an) anchor (of) a network of US allies and partners.” Taiwan in the #CCP’s hands breaks it out of the constraints of the first island chain. #AEIFDP 🧵 \n\nAccording to @StateDept, conflict over #Taiwan would cost the world economy $2.5 trillion. This sum does not quantify the huge strategic advantage the #CCP would gain if it seizes the crown jewels of the global economy—the fabrication of advanced computer chips. #AEIFDP 🧵\n\nTaiwan produces 92% of the world’s most advanced computer chips, which today are as important to our economy as the supply of oil has been for decades. A successful #CCP\/PLA invasion would be a massive blow to the technology that powers our digital age. #AEIFDP 🧵\n\nU.S. commitment to #Taiwan has been part of our law, heritage, trade, &amp; military deployments for decades. Too few Americans know the reasons for this commitment. We need to rebuild this understanding to ready ourselves for the test of will that is approaching. #AEIFDP 🧵\n\nJust last year—in the face of threats from #CCP—I was part of another demonstration of American commitment, traveling to #Taiwan w\/ @SenDuckworth &amp; @ChrisCoons to provide nearly 1 million vaccines for the Taiwanese people.\n\nThe fate of #Taiwan has been weaved in and out of the careers and professions of countless Americans, including my own. 27 years ago, I was a young Marine infantry officer deployed amid the Third Taiwan Strait Crisis. #AEIFDP 🧵\n\nThese stalwart congressional supporters of #Taiwan—Republicans and Democrats—understood the stakes, which encompassed issues of American leadership and our commitment to prevent a communist power from devouring an outpost of freedom in the Pacific. #AEIFDP 🧵\n\nAt the darkest time for #Taiwan, when the US switched diplomatic recognition from Taipei to Beijing and President Jimmy Carter wanted to abandon Taiwan, Congress said, “No,” passing the historic Taiwan Relations Act. #AEIFDP 🧵\n\nGoing back to the Eisenhower administration, there has been a long-standing, bipartisan American consensus focused on the security of the Republican of China on #Taiwan. #AEIFDP 🧵\n\nThe U.S. defended West Berlin because we understood that the city and its citizens stood on the frontline between the American-led free world, and a powerful, expansionist authoritarian regime. #Taiwan is the 21st Century’s West Berlin. \n\nThe world’s eyes are on Ukraine, and defeating authoritarian aggression in Europe is essential to deterring it in Asia. But we can’t lose sight of the threat to #Taiwan and what is at stake. #AEIFDP 🧵\n\nOn heels of 20th #CCP Congress, Xi has emerged as the ultimate supreme leader, surprising even seasoned China hands with his audacity. Xi &amp; his comrades may look ridiculous in military fatigues. But the message he delivered was clear—China is preparing for war. #AEIFDP 🧵 \n\nIn March 2021, #INDOPACOM Commander Davidson testified before @SASCGOP: “I think the threat of an invasion of #Taiwan is manifest during this decade. In fact, in the next six years.” Other senior intel\/defense leaders are ringing alarm bells, too. #AEIFDP 🧵\n\nToday at @AEI, I’ll be laying out what a takeover of #Taiwan by the #CCP\/PLA could mean for vital American interests &amp; security, and what we should do to deter it. My staff will be live-tweeting portions of my remarks. Watch live: \n\nLooking forward to the conversation this afternoon at @AEIFDP about the critical importance of #Taiwan. Tune in at 3:00pm ET  \n\nTHURS | 3PM: I’ll be speaking at @AEI tomorrow about the real, intensifying threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party against #Taiwan, and the high stakes for America’s economic and geostrategic interests. #AEIFDP @AEIFDP  Watch live: \n\nMy pledge to them was to strengthen and defend this critical alliance, which has proven to be an unparalleled instrument for keeping the peace in the Indo-Pacific and will continue to be vital as we counter the aggressive ambitions of the dictators in NK and Communist China.\n\n#China represents the greatest global threat to American interests, values, and prosperity this century. We have a lot of work to do to counter it and keep the peace. [7\/7] #ccp #CCPCongress\n\nXi doubled down on threats to #Taiwan with changes to the party constitution and military leadership—a reminder that the Chinese military belongs to the communist party, not the Chinese people. [6\/7] #ccp #CCPCongress\n\nXi solidified #China's retreat from market economics in favor of security for the #CCP. This will make China less competitive. Fine, but it makes the rest of the world less secure and subject to Beijing's economic predation. [5\/7] #CCPCongress\n\nXi emerges as supreme leader, beyond even what most thought possible at the start of the week. He's packed the #CCP leadership with loyalists, strengthened its grip on #China, and secured power for life. [2\/7] #CCPCongress\n\nWell, the big meeting of the Chinese Communist Party has wrapped up. And it's all bad news—for American values and interests, and the prospects for peace. 🧵 [1\/7] #ccp #CCPCongress\n\nThe US has extraordinary advantages relative to China’s dictatorship, if we are wise enough to use them. With our network of allies, world-class supplies of resources, lethal military, dynamic economy, democratic values &amp; commitment to liberty, America can meet the moment. [8\/8]\n\nDuring his opening speech to the Congress on Sunday, Xi got the most applause when he talked about the “wheels of history rolling toward reunification” (with Taiwan) and “rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.” [5\/8]\n\nJust like Mao had “Mao Zedong Thought” communism, Xi is jamming “Xi Jinping Thought” down the throats of his countrymen. The rise of Xi Jinping clearly spells a more dangerous time between the United States and China, and the rest of the world. [4\/8]\n\nThis week, #CCP leader Xi Jinping will coronate himself leader of China for life. We have challenges right now—inflation, skyrocketing energy costs, open borders, rising crime—but it’s important to keep an eye on what’s happening in Beijing. Why should Americans care? 🧵 [1\/8]\n\nHere’s a quick update on what’s going on in D.C., including:  100% federal cost share for #TyphoonMerbok  How to apply for state &amp; federal disaster aid  New permitting reform developments  Holding China accountable in treaties \n\nThis effort is ultimately about strategic competition with China. The Mekong is like the South China Sea of mainland Southeast Asia. The #CCP wants to own it. America must be an active participant in solutions for the region if we want to stop them. \n\nMy legislation ( ) mandates comprehensive &amp; crippling economic sanctions against the #CCP and key sectors of China’s economy if the PLA initiates a military invasion of the island democracy. Congress needs to pass my bill as soon as possible. [4\/4]\n\nAs for immediate actions, in addition to American military strength, we need to make clear to President Xi &amp; the #CCP the true economic costs of any military invasion of #Taiwan, which is exactly why I have introduced the STAND with Taiwan Act to do just that. [3\/4]\n\nThis is deadly serious business. There is bipartisan agreement in Congress on the China threat and there is no question we need to stand with #Taiwan, but the Biden administration needs to be more coherent. Repeated, uncoordinated, off-the-cuff gaffes are unacceptable. [2\/4]\n\nThe President &amp; his team are again in disarray. His comments committing US troops to defend #Taiwan, w\/o consulting Congress, and just weeks after sending officials to the Hill to water down expressions of support for Taiwan, are not only confusing—they are dangerous. [1\/4]\n\nHere’s a quick update on the past week, including:  My vote against Chuck Schumer’s reckless tax-and-spending bill  Welcoming Finland &amp; Sweden into the #NATO alliance  Standing with #Taiwan against #CCP threats  The Alaska Broadband Summit+Workshop (Join us!) \n\nThat was the motivation behind the statement I led with 25 of my Senate colleagues supporting Speaker Pelosi’s trip to #Taiwan. We cannot let the #CCP dictate where senior American officials travel. \n\nAs I told @Greta on @Newsmax this week, in the face of threats by the #CCP against #Taiwan, American officials need to close ranks and not allow our adversaries to drive wedges between us. \n\nFour months ago, the White House put out new rules making it harder to build our country. As soon as next week, the Senate votes on whether to rescind these regulations. The only people who like these rules are the radical environmental groups and the Chinese Communist Party. \n\nI believe in free trade, with one exception. The Chinese Communist Party does not play by the rules of the global economy. They cheat, they subsidize, they coerce and they steal. If we are going to out-compete the #CCP, our policy needs to reflect this reality. \n\nWe are in a new era of authoritarian aggression led by the dictators in Russia and China. The Biden administration needs to wake up to the fact that this new era—and our need for oil and gas—will be with us for decades to come.\n\nOne of the things the Chinese Communist Party fears more than anything else is American energy dominance. And, yet, this administration came in on day one and unilaterally disarmed one of our most important strategic advantages in the world. It’s national security suicide.\n\nThe biggest fans of President Biden’s radical energy policies are Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin. It is insulting and illogical to sell our strategic oil reserves to China while Americans suffer from record-high gas prices. \n\nI spoke w\/ @Greta on @Newsmax about 2 important pieces of legislation—1⃣ Mandating crippling sanctions to deter the #CCP from initiating a military invasion of #Taiwan, 2⃣ Democratizing the corporate governance structure by restoring voting rights to shareholders (#INDEXAct). \n\nI was motivated to introduce the #INDEXAct because of the hypocrisy of America’s largest banks black-balling oil and gas investment, specifically in Alaska, while at the same time eagerly propping up the Chinese Communist Party. [@BankingGOP] \n\nThere is nobody in the Biden administration who more regularly undermines America's national interests than John Kerry. Our so-called Climate Czar is well known for kowtowing to the Chinese Communist Party, kissing up to Iranian terrorists, all while trying to kill U.S. energy. \n\nIt’s disturbing that the Administration appears to be doing exactly what the Chinese Communist Party wants – economically isolating Taiwan. Instead of isolating Taiwan, the Biden Administration should be supporting this important island democracy.\n\nI have been encouraging senior Biden Administration officials for months not to leave Taiwan out of the Indo-Pacific Trade Pact. This is a strategic mistake that signals to Beijing they can call the shots economically in the Indo-Pacific. \n\n.@RepGallagher and I penned an op-ed detailing the instruments of American economic power we can use to deter another authoritarian, Xi Jinping in China, from militarily invading the global fulcrum between democracy and dictatorship—#Taiwan. Read here  \n\nBig U.S. banks &amp; financiers have no problem propping up the Chinese Communist Party, at the same time they blackball American energy workers. The American people are sick of the hypocrisy and I think there’s going to be a reckoning. \n\n@EPWGOP @SenKevinCramer @SenLummis Imagine if major economies, like China and India—whose annual GHG emissions are skyrocketing—transitioned to clean-burning American LNG. Models show this change alone could reduce global emissions by 9%. \n\nThe barbaric invasion of Ukraine makes clear we are in a new era of authoritarian aggression led by ruthless dictators—Vladimir Putin of Russia and President Xi Jinping of China. [1\/5]\n\nTonight, President Biden had the opportunity to change course on his war on American energy. He chose not to, dismissing the real hardships of American families and further emboldening our adversaries - including Russia and China. #SOTU\n\nGlad to speak with Chancellor @OlafScholz last night about how the U.S. and our European allies can work together to bolster vulnerable democracies and counter authoritarian aggression, especially at this inflection point in Ukraine and in the Taiwan Strait. \n\nGrateful to @NRO for spotlighting this challenge, which could change 21st century history in the same way the Guns of August changed the 20th century. My STAND with Taiwan Act would mandate heavy economic costs on China if the #CCP invades #Taiwan, increasing deterrence. \n\nCommunist China’s intimidation is a threat to our allies and our democratic values. We need to stand by Lithuania as they stand up to the #CCP’s aggression. \n\n.@FreeBeacon reports John Kerry has been lobbying Democrats to oppose a @MarcoRubio amendment to the #NDAA that would ban Uyghur slave labor imports, because Kerry fears it could threaten climate negotiations with the Chinese Communist Party. Whose side is this guy on? \n\nWhat American wouldn’t support banning the import of goods made with Uyghur slave labor in China? Evidently, there’s one: White House Climate Czar John Kerry. \n\nI've said it before and I'll say it again: John Kerry—appeaser of the terrorist leadership in Iran and collaborator with the Communist Party leadership in China—should be fired or resign. Rarely has an American official so blatantly sold out American interests. #KerrysGottaGo \n\nAmerica &amp; Taiwan share a commitment to democracy, peace, and economic prosperity, and our bilateral bonds are stronger than ever before. All Americans join our friends today in celebrating National Day, commemorating the establishment of the Republic of China.  \n\nPresident Biden needs to reiterate America’s clear, unflinching support for the people of #Taiwan. Greater provocation by the #CCP will only further isolate China and rally the nations of the world to the cause of peace in the Indo-Pacific. \n\nWe knew this was coming. I’ve been saying for weeks that China would be looking to test the Biden administration following the disastrous withdrawal from #Afghanistan. This historic debacle has clearly left our allies shaken and our adversaries emboldened. \n\nJust in the past few weeks, China’s Navy has been sailing off the coast of the Aleutian Islands within our Exclusive Economic Zone. We need to continue to increase our military presence in the #Arctic and the Indo-Pacific. The #AUKUS partnership will help us do that. \n\nThe new #AUKUS partnership, deepening the defense &amp; security ties with two of our longest-standing allies, will be important to maintaining peace &amp; stability in the Indo-Pacific and countering China’s efforts to subvert the international rules-based order. \n\nAs I shared with Dana and Bill, I am concerned our country’s adversaries—like China and Russia—will test the Biden administration in the aftermath of the botched withdrawal from #Afghanistan. If that happens, the administration had better be ready and they'd better be strong. \n\nFar-left environmental groups opposed my amendment because they want the US to continue importing minerals, solar panels, &amp; renewable energy tech from China, and they want to stop any production in America where we have the highest environmental standards and employ Americans. \n\nCritical minerals are crucial to our economy &amp; national security, and we have them in abundance in the US, particularly in Alaska. We cannot continue to be dependent on communist China for these resources, nor can we allow extreme environmentalists to block domestic production. \n\nAbout to speak on the Senate floor regarding my amendment that would block federal funds for the build-out of our domestic renewable energy industry from going to communist China. Watch here: \n\n@SquawkCNBC @SenJohnKennedy @SECGov @GaryGensler One of those critical tools is the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act. The law says, if you’re a Chinese company listed in the U.S., you must undergo the same audits that an American company has to. It’s simply an issue of fairness and leveling the playing field. \n\nSpoke w\/@SquawkCNBC about .@SenJohnKennedy &amp; my letter () urging @SECgov to enforce transparency requirements for US-listed Chinese companies. The debacle w\/ Chinese ride-share company #Didi &amp; the #CCP showed the significant risk for American investors. \n\nToday, I urged Sec. Blinken to rescind the Biden admin’s invitation for @UN_HRC to scrutinize American human rights. UNHRC, w\/members like China &amp; #Cuba and its shameful history of enabling abusers, has no business investigating the United States.  \n\nThe aims of the #Arctic Security Initiative are to maintain a favorable balance of power in the region, to defend the northern approaches to the American homeland, and to guard against China &amp; Russia’s attempts to disrupt the international rules-based order in the Arctic. \n\n“Failing to respond robustly to Xi’s increasing aggression and intimidation toward Taiwan is the surest way to invite more of it...” Must-read op-ed by @JoshRogin on vaccine diplomacy and the importance of my visit w\/@SenDuckworth &amp; @ChrisCoons to #Taiwan. \n\nI spoke with @MariaBartiromo on @FoxBusiness @MorningsMaria this week about stalled infrastructure negotiations and my recent trip to #Taiwan in which we announced the allocation of 750,000 American vaccines for the people of this island democracy.   \n\nThe $6 trillion Biden budget increases most federal agency spending by double digits, but defense &amp; homeland security are stagnant—not even keeping up w\/ inflation. This sends the wrong message to our adversaries, like China, which has consistently ramped up military investment. \n\nDs &amp; Rs alike are troubled by U.S. financiers, like Sequoia Capital &amp; Black Rock, getting rich funding the rise of the #CCP, America’s chief global adversary. #China doesn’t have this problem. I asked our @SASCGOP witnesses how damaging this is, and what we should do about it. \n\nMuch of China’s economic rise in recent years has come thanks to the #CCP’s access to American know-how and venture capital. In a @SASCGOP hearing yesterday, I asked our witnesses whether China’s economy could stall out if it lost access to these tools. \n\nCongrats @DamonMacWilson, my old @StateDept\/@WHNSC colleague, on your new role leading @NEDemocracy, a crucial partner of @IRIGlobal. Having just visited Korea &amp; Taiwan, it is undeniable how important NGOs, like NED, are to the cause of freedom &amp; strengthening young democracies. \n\nIt was great to work with @KeithJKRach in the last administration to support Taiwan’s prosperity, democracy and security, and help our friends resist the threats and coercion of the #CCP. We’re going to build on that progress in a bipartisan manner in the Senate. \n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

I'm laser-focused on continuing to deliver lasting results for AZ’s top priorities by the end of the year. \n\nWhen implementing our bipartisan CHIPS and Science law, the Administration must consider the full supply chain before awarding tax credits to ensure AZ semiconductor manufacturers can boost production, prevent bottlenecks, and reduce prices of goods. \n\nFollowing the passage of our bipartisan Chips and Science law, @Apple is shifting operations from Asia to Arizona – creating good-paying Arizona jobs, reducing our reliance on foreign nations, and bolstering our national security. \n\nWe toured @ASU’s MacroTechnology Works facility to see firsthand the investments our bipartisan Chips and Science law makes in semiconductor research and development. \n\nArizonans will be safer and more secure thanks to our bill to close loopholes used by foreign adversaries, like China and Russia, attempting to influence American policy.

Our legislation — which just passed Congress with bipartisan support — restores America’s leadership in semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nAZ is a leader in semiconductor manufacturing, but over the past decades, America’s chips manufacturing has fallen. We’re building on our CHIPS For America Act with new legislation to restore America’s global leadership in semiconductor manufacturing. \n\nJust over a year ago, parts of our CHIPS For America Act became law, boosting U.S. semiconductor manufacturing. Now, we’re urging Congressional leaders to do more to address rising prices and severe supply chain issues. \n\nWe led bipartisan proposals boosting U.S. manufacturing of semiconductors (computer chips) used for phones, computers, cars, and military technology. We’ll continue working to support good-paying jobs, protect national security, and lower the costs of goods. #SOTU\n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

I am excited to see how this is going to continue transforming our state’s economy next year and into the future.\n\nArizona’s defense community will continue to play a critical role in getting our servicemembers what they need to keep Americans safe and maintain our competitive edge over China. \n\nBecause of the investments made through the CHIPS Act of 2022 to bring microchip production to our state, we’re not going to have to depend on China for this critical technology.\n\nThis week, I met with TSMC Chairman, Dr. Mark Liu, to talk more about their investment plans in Arizona. It is great to see how the CHIPS Act and TSMC are working to bring more jobs and manufacturing to our state. \n\nWe’re on the road to a new future where the best chips in the world are made, from start to finish, here in America. And that road runs through the state of Arizona. \n\nA huge deal for Arizona: more investment, more jobs, more chips manufactured here and not an ocean away. This is exactly what we envisioned when we worked on the CHIPS Act. \n\nAfter months of bipartisan negotiations, we were able to pass the CHIPS Act of 2022 which is already bringing thousands of new, great-paying manufacturing jobs to Arizona, which will boost our economy and strengthen our national security. \n\nMore high paying jobs that don’t require a four-year degree; that’s what the CHIPS Act is bringing to Arizona.\n\nBecause of the passage of our CHIPS Act, Apple will use microchips made in Arizona —not overseas. This is a win for our country and a loss for China. \n\nThanks to my microchips manufacturing plan we’re fixing the shortage of microchips by creating more of them in the US. That’s going to create tens of thousands of new Arizona jobs, most of which do not require a four-year degree.\n\nThe CHIPS Act is now law and it’s bringing microchip manufacturing to Arizona. That’s helping us meet the high demand for microchips without relying on foreign supply chains, while creating jobs that don’t require a four-year degree.\n\nThe CHIPS Act is creating more high-paying manufacturing jobs in Arizona, reducing our reliance on foreign countries. It will help produce more microchips here at home, strengthening our economy, lowering costs, and bolstering national security.\n\nWe’re facing a shortage of microchips and have struggled to meet the growing demand. Thanks to the CHIPS Act, we are already boosting microchip manufacturing, creating more jobs in our state and helping build up our domestic industries.\n\nThe CHIPS Act is bringing tens of thousands of good paying jobs to Arizona. Programs like the Semiconductor Technician Quick Start Program will help prepare the workforce needed to fill these jobs. I spoke to two graduates of the program to learn more about their experience. \n\nNegotiating a bipartisan CHIPS Act deal, and getting it signed into law was hard work, but now we’ll bring microchip manufacturing to Arizona, creating jobs and lowering costs. Thank you to the @SIAAmerica for honoring me with the CHIPS Champion Award. \n\nThank you to @ASU and @WBJonline for hosting yesterday’s conversation. If you missed it, here is the topline: the CHIPS Act will create thousands of new, good paying jobs, lower costs, and protect our national security, bringing the most advanced microchip manufacturing to AZ. \n\nThe CHIPS Act is going to boost manufacturing jobs and help train workers for prepare a workforce that will work these new high-paying jobs. \n\nLet’s talk about microchips, again! \n\nEn caso de que se lo haya perdido, la secretaria del comercio y yo visitamos la universidad estatal de Arizona. Durante la visita, hablamos sobre las oportunidades para trabajos bien pagados que mi plan de fabricación de microchips, el cual ya es ley, está creando. \n\nOur CHIPS law will lower costs and boost Arizona microchip manufacturing. Now industry leaders have the guidance from @CommerceGov to make our CHIPS law a reality. We’ll keep working to ensure the administration swiftly and fairly implements our law. \n\nToday, I brought @SecRaimondo to ASU’s MacroTechnology Works Fab to see how we’re going to get Arizonans the skills they need to work the tens of thousands of microchip manufacturing jobs coming to our state from the CHIPs Act, most of which don’t require a four year degree. \n\nArizona is already an emerging microchip hub, and I’m excited to continue working with @azcommerce to take maximum advantage of the opportunity created by our CHIPS Act to make sure Arizona leads the way in returning microchip manufacturing and development to the United States. \n\nThis morning, I joined @ASU and industry leaders to discuss how the CHIPS Act is going to create great-paying jobs and support STEM and workforce programs to get Arizonans the skills they need to work them. \n\nThe CHIPS Act will help boost the microchip supply chain and support manufacturing in Chandler thanks to companies like @NXP. \n\nThe passage of our CHIPS Act of 2022 is going to help bring down the cost of consumer products, create tens of thousands of great-paying Arizona jobs, and strengthen our national security. \n\nIf you’ve recently tried to buy a new car and waited months, or paid more than you were expecting, the microchip shortage is a big reason why. We’re fixing it by boosting American manufacturing of microchips.\n\nOur microchips manufacturing bill was just passed by the House! This means that its on its way to the president’s desk to be signed into law. We got it done. \n\nMicrochips are in everything from cellphones to the most advanced fighters jets. They are a critical part of our national security and economy, and we can’t rely on an overseas supply chain. We need to make more of them here. \n\nWe need to stop relying on China for the rare earth minerals used in our defense systems. It’s a serious national security risk. I have legislation to fix this by strengthening our supply chain of rare earths here in the U.S. \n\nWe’re facing a shortage of microchips and our country doesn’t have the capacity right now to produce enough of them. It's a big problem that I'm working hard to fix. \n\nAs Chair of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee, I recently led a hearing that focused on @USSOCOM’s ability to sustain counterterrorism, while accelerating efforts to better compete with adversaries like China and Russia. \n\nThank you @MayorCCarlat for stopping by my office to talk about microchips, and the economic boost coming to Peoria as a result of TSMC's new facility. I'm eager to work together to pass my domestic microchip manufacturing plan, and bring even more good paying jobs to Arizona. \n\nI'm working to create more high-paying manufacturing jobs in Arizona so we can reduce our reliance on foreign countries. My plan to produce more microchips here at home will strengthen the local economy, help bring down rising costs, and bolster national security.\n\nAfter our year-long effort to push this microchip manufacturing plan through Congress, we're closer than ever to getting it over the finish line. I'll keep working to finalize this bill so we can manufacture more microchips right here in Arizona. \n\nI was briefed today, alongside my Republican and Democratic colleagues, by national security officials on semiconductor supply chain vulnerabilities. Our reliance on foreign nations for microchips is a threat to our economy and national security.\n\nAs Chair of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee, I'm working on how to stop illicit drug trafficking from Central and South America. It's also important that we make the investments needed to counter Russia and China's rising influence in the region. \n\nIf more microchips are manufactured here at home, we'll create thousands of high-paying Arizona jobs while also strengthening our national security. I agree with @MichaelCrow, it's a win-win. \n\nMicrochips: they're in everything from cars to cell phones to coffee machines. We need to make more of these tiny chips here at home instead of relying on adversaries like China. I have a domestic chip manufacturing plan that I'm pushing to get signed into law soon.\n\nWhen U.S. companies have to halt or cut back their operations because they’re relying on microchips manufactured overseas, that’s a problem. The plan I secured in the Senate will help us make more microchips on American soil, especially here in Arizona.\n\n¿Sabes por qué han subido los precios de los carros? La escasez de microchips es parte del problema. Aseguré un plan de $52 mil millones en el Senado para reforzar la cadena de suministro de microchips y reducir su costo. Tenemos que convertirlo en ley lo antes posible.\n\nLet's talk about microchips. \n\nOur plan to boost domestic microchip manufacturing will create thousands of high-paying jobs, lower costs, and reduce our reliance on adversaries like China. I'll keep working with both Republicans and Democrats to get this across the finish line as soon as possible. \n\nMy bipartisan bill will strengthen America’s position as a global leader in technology by reducing our reliance on adversaries like China. \n\nIncreased hypersonic research and development is critical for American national security. These investments I worked on in the annual defense bill will help maintain our competitive edge over adversaries like China. \n\nArizona is already a leader in microchips — and I secured and passed a $52 billion deal that will grow the industry further and bring thousands of high-paying jobs to our state. \n\nAs Chair of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee, I'm focused on making sure our military maintains its competitive edge over adversaries like China. @UArizona's leadership in hypersonics research will play an important role in this mission. \n\nChina needs to be held accountable for its widespread human rights abuses in Xinjiang. We came together, Republicans and Democrats, to pass this bill barring any imports from the region that were made with forced labor. \n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

That's why I'm working to get the bipartisan CHIPS Act across the finish line. \n\nGreat meeting with @ChandlerChamber leaders this afternoon to talk about the work we're doing in Congress to support Chandler local businesses. We discussed the CHIPS Act that I worked to pass, which will advance Chandler's position as a leader in semiconductor manufacturing. \n\nI’m proud that our bipartisan bill to track foreign money in mergers passed the House. We have to stand up for U.S. businesses + consumers, and ensure that Chinese government-backed enterprises can't distort our markets or jeopardize our national security.\n\nWe have to get serious about the risk that Chinese government-backed companies pose to our economic competitiveness and national security. My bipartisan amendment to the COMPETES Act levels the playing field for American businesses and protects consumers. \n\nGreat to talk with @Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger about the #CHIPSAct. Intel’s $20bil investment for 2 new semiconductor plants in Arizona is a great example of the benefits that come from investing in domestic semiconductor manufacturing capabilities—Congress needs to get this done. \n\nI was honored to celebrate the Cutler-Plotkin Jewish Heritage Center's 100th anniversary. The center's rich and diverse history, as Phoenix's first synagogue and at one point housing Chinese and Spanish-speaking churches, helped shape our community as we know it. \n\nOur economy works best when competition is fair and the playing field is level. I'm working across the aisle to ensure that businesses with Chinese government-controlled investment stakes can't wrongfully influence markets and jeopardize national security.\n\nArizona is a leader in semiconductor design and manufacturing.

YMTC’s blacklisting is long overdue. \n\nThere is no reason we should let Chinese companies like Huawei dominate 5G and steal Americans’ data. My bill with ⁦@ChrisVanHollen⁩ will address the threat Huawei and the CCP pose to our national security. \n\nPresident Biden needs to express clear American support for the brave Chinese protesting against their totalitarian regime instead of trying to appease the CCP. \n\nNo US agency should approve this mining deal until we can be certain that China will not control it.\n\nI sent a letter in September to @SecGranholm warning her that a lithium mining company with CCP ties operating in the US would only increase our mineral dependence on China. via @amermilnews\n\nWe must address the immigration policies that allow China to conduct espionage at American universities. Tune in  \n\nWe must end China’s Permanent Normal Trade Relations status. This status gives privileges to the Chinese Communists that they never earned and continue to abuse. I’m glad that the US-China Commission has endorsed my position on this long-overdue decision. \n\nJoe Biden has again failed to address or even acknowledge China’s Cold War against the United States. His naive return to a policy of appeasement will hurt the United States, endanger Taiwan, and further embolden Xi Jinping.\n\nWe need to know why TikTok uses foreign nationals with Chinese state ties to handle American citizens’ data—and why ⁦⁦@SecMayorkas⁩ approved those visas. \n\nAllowing CCP-controlled YMTC into iPhones would have put our national security at serious risk and made us more reliant on China. I’m glad that Apple is dropping YMTC, as I urged last month, but they should not have considered YMTC in the first place. \n\nThis is a good first step, but we must do more to win our economic long war with China. The Commerce Dept. should blacklist more Chinese tech firms &amp; stop slow-walking its legal requirement to identify and protect emerging, foundational technologies. \n\nThe Department of Energy shouldn’t consider funding a company with ties to the Chinese Communist Party. We need to reduce our mineral independence on China, not help them gain a foothold in the U.S. #FoxNews\n\nJoe Biden’s aides keep walking back his statements, which provokes the Chinese without deterring them. To stop a Chinese invasion, our message must be clear: we will defend Taiwan. via @BreitbartNews\n\nDespite what the President told the UN, the United States is already in a Cold War with China. We can only choose whether to win or lose.\n\nI sent a letter to Tim Cook warning him that Apple's business with China's YMTC will endanger both their own supply chain and the United States. He should explain why Apple would risk customers' privacy by partnering with this state-controlled company. \n\nApple's decision to partner with China's YMTC endangers their own supply chain, their shareholders, and the United States. @tim_cook should change course and explain his actions. \n\nWe should not allow a single new tendril of communist influence to take root in American soil. We must stop China’s land grab now. \n\nChinese nationals shouldn’t be able to purchase American farmland and agricultural companies. We should protect those critical assets for our own country. \n\nJoe Biden is doing Beijing’s dirty work by lobbying to block Congressional support for Taiwan. \n\nPresident Joe Biden’s irresolution and incompetence has transformed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to Taiwan into a major international incident. \n\nChinese investments in US farmland put our food security at risk &amp; provide opportunities for espionage against our military bases &amp; critical infrastructure. Instead of allowing these purchases, the US government must bar the CCP from purchasing our land. \n\nJoe Biden’s weakness is letting Xi Jinping rewrite the status quo of our relationship with Taiwan. That needs to stop. \n\nThe Chinese Communist Party shouldn’t be able to own U.S. soil. My bill will put an end to their land grab. \n\nA vote in the House today for the CHIPs bill is in effect a vote for the Democrats new $1 trillion tax-and-spend blowout. House Republicans should all vote no now that Democrats have shown their cards.\n\nNot a single House Republican should help Democrats spend $250b on the CHIPs bill when Democrats just announced they plan to spend half a trillion more.\n\nWe cannot allow threats from Beijing to deter members of Congress from visiting Taiwan. We must instead reaffirm our commitment to helping Taiwan defend itself against Chinese aggression. \n\nWe should be bolstering manufacturing at home—not expanding abroad. My amendment will ensure companies that receive taxpayer funds can’t turn around and build more factories in China. \n\nWe’ve known for a long time that Huawei is a bad actor—but the Chinese Communist Party uses all of its technology companies to harm the United States. Why would you trust any of them? The US government needs to crack down on TikTok, DJI, YMTC, etc. \n\n‘Strategic ambiguity’ isn’t working. China needs to know that if it attacks Taiwan, the U.S. will respond. \n\nThis Biden official isn’t just soft on China—this is Chinese Communist party propaganda. The United States should continue doing whatever is necessary to support our friends in Taiwan and deter Beijing. \n\nThe Biden administration’s plan to roll back tariffs on the Chinese Communist Party is just another example of Joe Biden blaming inflation on someone else. \n\nChina will do a lot worse to protect its stranglehold on global rare earth elements, which are used in everything from batteries to fighter jets. Time to pass my REEshore Act and end our dependence, now. \n\nThe Chinese Communist Party continues to harvest organs from persecuted religious groups, prisoners of conscience, and inmates. @ChrisCoons and I introduced legislation to hold the CCP accountable for these heinous crimes. \n\nPresident Biden should be protecting Americans’ data—instead he’s protecting a Chinese company harvesting that data. We need to know why Secretary Yellen is shielding TikTok’s owner, Bytedance. \n\nCertainty is essential to deterrence. The United States should end the policy of strategic ambiguity and adopt one of strategic clarity. There must be no doubt: we will fight to defend Taiwan, and China will lose if it invades. \n\nWe must now back Ukraine to the hilt, not only to check further aggression by Russia, but to send a clear message to Communist China that if it invades Taiwan, it too will fail. Just as Russia watched what happened in Afghanistan, China is watching what’s unfolding in Ukraine.\n\nTune in at 9am as I speak to the Jamestown Foundation about the implications of the Russia-Ukraine war for Taiwan. \n\nThe Chinese Communist Party and other foreign entities shouldn’t have access to sensitive government information. Our bill will prioritize American requests and prevent our adversaries from stockpiling U.S. government information. \n\n33 years ago, the Chinese Communist Party rolled tanks into Tiananmen Square, killing thousands of peaceful protestors seeking freedom. We will never forget the true face of Chinese communism that we saw that day or the bravery and sacrifice of those Chinese students.\n\nChina wants to gain power by manipulating the market and undercutting American businesses. Our bill makes it easier to investigate whether companies are making decisions to please their foreign investors. \n\nThe Chinese Communist Party will use its digital currency to control and spy on anyone who uses it. We can’t give China that chance—the United States should reject China’s attempt to undermine our economy at its most basic level. \n\nPresident Biden needs to make it clear to the world and to Beijing that our new Taiwan policy is strategic clarity. If China invades, we will come to Taiwan’s aid. \n\nIt is essential that President Biden declare the United States will come to Taiwan’s defense in the event of a Chinese attack. Continued ambiguity will provoke the Chinese communists without deterring them—the worst of both worlds. \n\nThe @WHO’s botched response to covid proved its allegiance to the Chinese Communist Party. The U.S. should immediately withdraw from this corrupt organization. \n\nOur China policy should be strategic decoupling. We cannot depend on the Chinese Communist Party for critical goods that are necessary to our safety, health, or prosperity. \n\nBolstering the United States’ presence in the Pacific islands is critical to countering Chinese aggression and expansion. Establishing additional diplomatic posts in the region will allow the U.S. to better combat Chinese influence. \n\nThe American Made Pharmaceuticals Act would reduce dependence on China for pharmaceuticals by boosting production at home. The bill would also create incentives to onshore manufacturing of essential medicine and take steps to improve the supply chain. \n\nThe Anyone But China Safe Drug Act would allow the U.S. to track active pharmaceutical ingredients, prohibit pharmaceutical purchases from China, and create transparency within the medical supply chain. \n\nShortages in the medical supply chain are a matter of life and death, and we cannot rely on China for our citizens’ survival. I’ve introduced two bills to curb our reliance on the Chinese Communist Party and bolster pharmaceutical production in the United States.\n\nIt’s more urgent than ever that we decouple from China. We can’t depend on the whims of communist Chinese officials when it comes to Americans’ health and safety. \n\nThe US already has more extreme pro-abortion laws than most countries. America is one of only 7 countries that allow elective abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy--along with communist China and North Korea. The Democrats’ bill would entrench this radicalism in law.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party threatened to cut off America’s access to vital drugs during the pandemic. It’s time to bolster onshore manufacturing of pharmaceuticals to ensure Americans never have to rely on China for lifesaving medicine. \n\nArkansas farmers grow the safest, most reliable food in the world. They help keep the United States and other nations safe from dependence on China for food, which the Chinese Communist Party would leverage for its own advantage. \n\nWe shouldn’t allow the Chinese Communist Party to use its corrupt courts to excuse the theft of American intellectual property. Our bill will help protect U.S. innovation from these lawless “anti-suit injunctions”—a naked attempt to steal American IP. \n\nFree trade isn’t free unless it flows both ways. China isn’t engaged in free trade, not even close.\n\nChina’s entry into the WTO in 2001 began a hollowing out of America’s industrial base, economy, and working class. Many states, like mine, have lost a quarter of their manufacturing jobs. Factories closed, families splintered, and opportunities crumbled.\n\nBoth parties are complicit in one of the single worst mistakes of this generation: granting Communist China Permanent Most Favored Nation status and admitting it into the World Trade Organization.\n\nWe must take a firm stance against Russia so that Xi Jinping doesn't follow Putin's lead by invading Taiwan. \n\nWe never should have sent our athletes to Beijing, and I hope that President Biden hasn’t set up them up for a lifetime of surveillance and exploitation by the Chinese Communist Party. \n\nEnding America’s dependence on the Chinese Communist Party for extraction and processing of rare-earth elements is critical to protecting our national security. \n\nOur athletes’ safety, security, and privacy shouldn’t be in the bloodstained hands of the Chinese Communist Party. President Biden has failed Team USA. \n\nJoe Biden has once again sold out American workers for the demands of climate alarmists and the Chinese Communist Party. \n\nStarting this week, China’s genocidal prison state will host the 2022 Winter Olympics. It didn’t have to be this way, but the Biden administration and the IOC kowtowed to the Chinese Communist Party. \n\nInstead of attacking a free democracy where Jews, Christians, and Muslims live in peace, Amnesty International should focus on the genocide taking place in China.\n\nIf you engage in joint R&amp;D, share IP, or invest with the Chinese government, you shouldn’t receive CHIPS money. \n\nIf President Biden fails to deter—or severely punish—Putin for the crisis in Ukraine, China will look to Taiwan and the Iranians will continue to pursue nuclear weapons. \n\nGrowing tensions between Russia and Ukraine should be used as a lesson. We must provide Taiwan with just as much—if not more—support to avoid a similar crisis with the Chinese Communist Party. \n\nThe Beijing Winter Olympics should be moved somewhere safe, free, and democratic. We cannot trust the Chinese Communist Party to protect our athletes. \n\nEnding American dependence on China for rare-earths extraction and processing is critical to building up the U.S. defense and technology sectors. \n\nThe Chinese Communist Party has a chokehold on global rare-earth element supplies, which are used in everything from batteries to fighter jets. Ending America’s dependence on the CCP is critical to protecting our national security. \n\nMany of the so-called journalists at the Global Times also harvest intelligence for the Chinese Communist Party. Joe Biden shouldn’t be making it easier for these operatives to spy on Americans and other critics of the CCP. \n\nReentering the INF agreement would be a gift to Putin. It would tie our hands while adversaries like China and Russia build and deploy dangerous new weapons. \n\nI’m grateful for the work of Americans like James Carr from Searcy, who stand for protecting religious freedom everywhere. By sanctioning him, the Chinese Communist Party is admitting its evil deeds. \n\nIf the Pentagon wants to find extremists they should look to the Chinese Communist Party and Vladimir Putin’s Russia.\n\nWe should do everything we can to reduce our reliance on China—especially for things like advanced technology and lifesaving drugs. \n\nShortages in the medical supply chain are a matter of life and death, and we cannot rely on China for our citizens’ survival. Our bill will encourage pharmaceutical production in friendly countries and end dependency on the Chinese Communist Party. \n\nWe must continue to stand alongside Taiwan, help secure its autonomy, and maintain the status quo. President Biden cannot kowtow to Beijing. \n\nThere is nothing normal about our trade relationship with China, and we cannot afford for it to be permanent. We should end Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China.\n\n20 years ago, China joined the WTO, marking the beginning of the Great Hollowing of our nation’s industrial base, economy, and working class. This was one of the greatest foreign policy mistakes in our nation’s history.\n\nBill Clinton once said that it was “ironic that so many Americans are concerned about the impact on the world of a strong China.” He was wrong, and the Americans he derided were right. \n\nTwenty years ago China joined the World Trade Organization, marking one of the greatest foreign policy mistakes in our nation's history. \n\nFrom the beginning of this pandemic, Tony Fauci and public health bureaucrats have been more concerned with protecting the feelings of the Chinese Communist Party than with protecting the American people. \n\nIf the Chinese Communists disappear their own athletes, just think how much less they’ll care for the safety of ours during the Olympics. #WhereIsPengShuai \n\nThe United States must implement a complete and total boycott of the Beijing Winter Olympics. The threat to our athletes and China’s crimes against humanity leave us no other option. \n\nSemiconductor companies doubling down on investments in China shouldn’t receive CHIPs funds. \n\nTikTok is a Trojan Horse used by the Chinese Communist Party to harvest data from Americans and others around the globe. The company should have never been considered as a sponsor for the U.S. Cyber Games. \n\nThe NBA allows its players to kneel during the national anthem, but punishes players for speaking out against human rights violations in China. Pathetic, but not surprising. \n\nAllowing a Chinese state-sponsored data harvesting company to be the lead sponsor for the U.S. Cyber Games is another unbelievable demonstration of this administration’s incompetence. \n\nIt would be a catastrophe of historic proportions to allow China to invade and annex Taiwan. The United States must remain steadfast in our commitment to our friends in Taiwan. \n\nUntil Alan Estevez confirms that he will address the threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party, he has no business serving at the Department of Commerce. \n\nOur nation deserves leaders who will vigorously confront China and strip its enablers in the China Lobby from positions of power and influence. \n\nJoe Biden is hoping to make peace with China by indulging its aggression. \n\nWhether we seek it or not, Communist China has waged a Cold War against us for years. Our only choice is to win or lose. \n\nUnder Joe Biden, America is folding to China like a cheap suit.\n\n4) Perhaps most egregiously, John Kerry appears to have convinced the administration to downplay China’s genocide against the Uyghurs in exchange for vague Chinese promises of cooperation on climate change.\n\n2) His Commerce Secretary talked about the need to strengthen business ties with China and welcome Chinese investment. 3) The administration is surrendering to China’s hostage diplomacy by dropping criminal charges against a Huawei executive currently held in Canada.\n\nThis week, the Biden administration returned to a policy of appeasing China, a strategy that’s failed for decades. 1) Joe Biden refused to even say the word “China” during his United Nations speech.\n\nChina is waging a Cold War against the United States. Joe Biden doesn't have a choice whether we're in it or not—we only have the option to win or to lose. \n\nPresident Biden didn't even say \"China\" during his UN speech. He should clearly state the threat China poses to the world—not pretend it doesn't exist.\n\nThe president said that the United States will not seek a new cold war with China. But the Chinese Communist Party started one years ago—Joe Biden should be trying to win it: \n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

Holding China to account for their abuses of power must be the priority of freedom loving people everywhere.\n\nTo assist the IC’s investigation of COVID’s origins in any way over the next 90-days, House Intel needs members who can put America’s interests first, not China. Eric Swalwell has been directly compromised by #China and Speaker Pelosi must remove him from the committee.\n\nI'm encouraged to see the Biden Administration backpedal from its naive faith in @WHO to investigate the origin of COVID &amp; China's role in it. Too bad it took a @WSJ expose to bring the Admin to its senses. Of course we need our IC investigating. \n\nNearly 500 - you read that right - federally funded scientists are under investigation for being compromised by the CCP. China is not only our greatest economic threat but the greatest threat to out long term viability as a nation. It's time to wake up! \n\nThe CCP has, for decades, taken advantage of American farmers and now want them to finance their malicious behavior. The merger of these companies is a major concern given China’s long history of engaging in economic espionage and agriculture-related intellectual property theft. \n\nI’m glad to see this report and I hope the Biden Administration shows a similar level of resolve and strength that Jimmy Carter did when he boycotted the 1980 Olympics due to Russia aggression. China has mistreated Uighur’s for too long and this must change. \n\nIt’s hard to imagine but President Jimmy Carter showed greater strength when he boycotted the 1980 Olympics due to Russia’s involvement in Afghanistan. Maybe ethnic cleansing in China isn’t egregious enough for President Biden and the 2022 Olympics 🤷‍ \n\nThis recent study proves what we already know – on a level playing field, our steel producers can compete with anyone in the world. Strong and effective enforcement of Section 232 tariff policy forces bad foreign actors, like China, to end their malicious behavior. #SteelTariffs \n\nPres. Biden's coordinated effort to sanction China with allies across the EU today is critical to hold them accountable for the humanitarian atrocities they have committed against Uighur minorities. This is an important move at an important time to stop these horrible actions.\n\nChina is the number one threat to America, our interests domestically &amp; abroad. Their treatment of Biden Admin officials show how contemptuous they feel about America. Senator Cotton has a great outline of how Pres Biden should pursue a new strategy: \n\nFrom the start, I’ve sought to hold China\/CCP accountable for covering up the start of the virus spread, with help from @WHO . This week, I sent a letter to end taxpayer support for studying viruses at the lab in Wuhan: \n\nThe NIH secretively spent Americans’ tax dollars to fund a notorious bioagent lab run by the Chinese Communist Party that is now suspected of causing the COVID-19 pandemic. We need to defund this dangerous CCP-operated facility permanently! #China #CCP \n\nCongress must ensure there are safeguards in place that prevents fraud like this flowing from *any* federal relief we pass, from this point forward. Tax dollars going to Russia, China, and not Americans? Unacceptable and we must hold them accountable! \n\nIt’s hard to grasp how China wants to dominate global commerce in every possible way. We have seen them act dishonestly in Arkansas and this last year, the global stage with COVID. Reports indicate another troubling move by the CCP to advance it further: \n\nIn all that we have seen over the last several years, and even well before that, we should all recognize that China is a danger to both humanity in its treatment of ethnic minorities as well as to other competitive nations, like America. This is a new era...\n\nAlso, a short time ago CBP determined that all cotton and tomato shipments from China should be stopped, due to those items being harvested by Uighur slaves.... \n\nThere is a near continual stream of indictments such as this one where individuals at research institutions across the country are being arrested after having been found with ties to China... \n\nWhy stop there? How about a public statement that a President-Elect Biden Admin won’t have ANY meetings with any lobbyist - or in this case, a foreign agent - helping the CCP and China? Oh, and what’s the deal with California Democrats and China? \n\nYou know who a “threat to democracy” was, and probably still is?

This bill would deter Chinese aggression against Taiwan by requiring the Treasury Sec. to publish and freeze the financial assets of senior CCP officials and their relatives. \n\nWe should be especially concerned by Russia’s ability to exchange its SDRs for Renminbi, especially as Moscow is increasingly forced to turn to China in response to our sanctions.\n\nNo one could expect the MD to speak truth to China. @USTreasury must lead.

I discussed my efforts in Congress to prevent Chinese control of US farmland, the upcoming Farm Bill, and worker shortages. \n\nThe bill delivers a slew of Republican wins including: Freeing our military from any COVID vaccine mandates Substantially investing in military modernization &amp; shipbuilding to deter and compete w\/ China Reversing suggested cuts to our missile defense programs by Pres Biden\n\nI recently joined POTUS Radio on @SIRIUSXM to discuss Republicans' #CommitmentToAmerica including combatting inflation, energy production, and China's attempt to buy farmland in the U.S. Listen below! \n\nI joined @RepNewhouse’s bill because food security is national security. China should not have any control over our agriculture. \n\nIf you think unchecked corporate welfare works, have you taken a commercial flight lately? #CHIPSAct\n\nThat is rotten to the core and utterly out of touch with the American people. 80% of Americans do not support the right of an abortion up until birth, the policy of which puts us on par with China and North Korea. 2\/3\n\nDemocrats’ abortion proposals, like H.R. 8296, would put U.S. abortion law on par with North Korea and China. This is not about health care. This about bowing to the radical left and its demand for abortion without limits, even until birth.\n\nBiden sold one million barrels of oil from our emergency reserve to China while the US pays $5\/gallon. I wonder who he will blame when the SPR runs dry &amp; gas prices continue to skyrocket. As long as Biden strangles US oil and gas production, we will never see reasonable prices.\n\nWhile Russia is banned from buying ads on Facebook, China has bought 21+ ads pushing Russian propaganda. That is why I sent a letter with @RepYoungKim to @Meta asking why the CCP is allowed to spew lies meant to divide Americans.

I look forward to a response by the end of this month.\n\nICYMI - Read my op-ed in @townhallcom on Congressional Democrats’ America COMPETES Act recently passed in the House. “Many believe that this bill is weak on China, but it’s worse; it’s simply not about China at all.” \n\nI voted NO on Democrats’ America CONCEDES Act because it  Sends US dollars to China through a UN Climate slush fund  Increases critical mineral imports from China  Ignores China’s use of slave labor\n\nToday, I joined 121 Republicans to express my frustration to @SpeakerPelosi after thousands of masks purchased from China were distributed to House members and staff. With “Made in China” emblazoned on the side, these masks signal to Americans where our Speaker’s priorities lie. \n\nThe NDAA also: Holds the Admin accountable for a disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal Requires an investigation into the CCP’s involvement in the birth of COVID Holds China accountable for human rights violations Protects servicemembers who decide against the COVID vaccine\n\nThis final version of the NDAA: Reverses @POTUS’s dangerous cuts to defense spending Invests in overdue cybersecurity improvements Modernizes our military capabilities Decreases US reliance on China\n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

The Mexican gov could be doing a ton more to stop this trade, but they need help from the U.S.\n\nWhen I was in Mexico earlier this year, I saw how the free flow of fentanyl precursor chemicals from China has created a nightmare of cheap Mexican production. Fentanyl must be a higher priority for the U.S. in our relationship with China and Mexico. \n\nIf this deal goes through, two of the most important U.S. social media platforms will be owned, in whole or in part, by China (TikTok) and Saudi Arabia (Twitter).

I went to industry leader ThayerMahan in Groton today to tour their facility. Both the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS Act will help ThayerMahan grow. \n\nI thought the whole point of selling arms to the Gulf States despite their human rights abuses, nonsensical Yemen War, working against US interests in Libya, Sudan etc, was that when an international crisis came, the Gulf could choose America over Russia\/China. \n\nThe only way to counter an increasingly effective Chinese industrial policy is with an even more effective American industrial policy. Ours will be very different than theirs, but pretending the private sector alone can compete with China is foolhardy. \n\nWhen I was in Mexico last month, I heard about how the virtually unrestricted flow of fentanyl ingredients from China to Mexico. America needs to be clear with both China and Mexico - the fentanyl supply chain needs to be shut down. \n\nI will be on @Morning_Joe around 7:10 to talk about Ukraine, China and the many issues on the agenda at the UN General Assembly this week.

The massive investments we’re seeing in U.S. manufacturing of semiconductor chips will bring real benefits to small businesses and consumers in eastern CT.\n\nThe CHIPS and Science Act we passed this summer is turbocharging domestic manufacturing of semiconductor chips. Apple’s move to source their chips from here in the U.S. rather than Asia is a clear sign of the shift coming in the tech sector. \n\nWe’ve gotten some big things done in Congress recently, and lots of it in bipartisan fashion.

China.\n\nThe #CHIPSandScience Act will set up the next boom in American innovation. It strengthens our supply chains, lowers costs, and brings vital manufacturing back to the US. We passed this bill on a bipartisan basis, and now, it’s been signed into law. \n\nThe bipartisan #CHIPSandScienceAct shows America is ready to make the long-term commitment needed to build up our own base of semiconductor manufacturing, and will set the stage for the next great boom in U.S. innovation and job creation. This week, it’s getting signed into law. \n\nIf you want to understand how critical passage of the #CHIPSAct is, listen to my colleague Rep. Meijer. I wholeheartedly agree. \n\nWe just passed the #CHIPSandScience Act – a bill to boost American innovation, grow our STEM workforce, and lower costs for families. The bill is now on its way to the President's desk for signature. \n\nChina’s unlawful militarization of Indo-Pacific is raising alarm bells for democratic nations around the world. That’s a big reason why the new #AUKUS alliance is so important. The House-passed NDAA includes 2 provisions I authored that would help make AUKUS a success. \n\nMy amendment to the #AmericaCOMPETES Act will help ensure that when our government is in need of drone tech, it buys it from distributors like RADeCO in Plainfield, not their competitors in China. Proud to deliver this win for American innovation – now we need to make it final! \n\nThe House-passed #AmericaCOMPETES Act would fund the production of semiconductor chips at home.

A strong American-Taiwanese relationship is vital to our national and economic security, and I was grateful to have the opportunity to discuss these issues with the President. \n\nGreat news today for Central Florida! Proud to help secure this funding to create good-paying jobs in our community, address the microchip shortage, increase the resiliency of our supply chains, and reduce our reliance on foreign competitors like China. \n\nLast month, the House passed the bipartisan National Defense Authorization Act, which included numerous provisions that I authored. This week, I'll be highlighting a few, starting with this measure to help us learn more about China's military #FY23NDAA \n\nI strongly condemn China’s increasing aggression against Taiwan, a critical partner of the United States. Such escalation is reckless and irresponsible. Taiwan remains a model for democracy. The U.S. commitment to the island is unshakable. \n\nHappy to vote YES on the #CHIPSandScience Act. With this bill we will:  Boost American manufacturing  Fund innovation  Fight climate change  Strengthen national security \n\nAs vice chair of the subcommittee that oversees U.S. special operations forces, I just filed legislation to require DOD to assess the capabilities of China’s special forces—a subject we need more info on. I’ll work to include my legislation in Congress’s annual defense bill. \n\nThe Trump tariffs contribute to inflation, harm U.S. families &amp; companies, &amp; haven’t stopped the CCP from violating trade rules. The Biden administration should repeal or reduce these tariffs. Keeping a failed policy in place isn’t tough on China; it’s bad for America. \n\nGood to meet again with General Richard Clarke, the commander of U.S. Special Operations Command. SOCOM is both spearheading the counter-terrorism fight and combatting threats from nations like Russia, China, and Iran—who don’t share our interests or values. \n\nHonored to meet with General Laura Richardson to discuss Florida-based @Southcom activities in Latin America &amp; the Caribbean, China and Russia’s growing influence in the region, the crisis in Venezuela, and our support for allies and partners in our shared neighborhood. \n\nIntroduced a bipartisan bill w\/ @HouseForeignGOP leader @RepMcCaul to promote trade between the U.S. &amp; Africa. This will create opportunities for American &amp; African businesses and workers, support our allies on the continent, and counter China. \n\nThe right to vote is sacred in our country. Holding free and fair elections is what separates us from autocratic countries like Russia, China, and Iran. This should not be a partisan issue. Patriots of all political stripes should unite to defend our democracy. \n\nGreat to meet with the @ORLPartnership to discuss how the new bipartisan infrastructure law will help Florida. We also talked about how the CHIPS for America Act—which will hopefully become law soon—could bring good semiconductor jobs to Orlando and enhance our national security. \n\nMy bipartisan bill to counter China’s efforts in Latin America and the Caribbean recently passed the House.

America must continue to stand for democracy and freedom.\n\nInvesting in technology is investing in the American Economy. I voted for the CHIPS Act to bring back jobs to the United States.\n\nMy Solar Supply Chain Act, a pro-worker legislation would:  Invest in American factories and American workers  Create jobs  Secure our solar supply chain  Hold China accountable  Take on climate change.\n\nI voted for the CHIPS Act to: Grow the economy Create good-paying blue-collar iobs Ease supply chain bottlenecks Invest in U.S. manufacturing Strengthen national security\n\nAcross the globe, authoritarian leaders in Cuba, China, and Russia have restricted internet access and spread disinformation, threatening global stability and our security.

My legislation, the Reclaiming the Solar Supply Chain Act, would bring solar jobs from China back home to Florida and invest in U.S.-based solar manufacturing.\n\nOur tax dollars and American jobs shouldn’t be going to China. I called for new screening to protect taxpayer money, stop American jobs from being outsourced overseas, secure our supply chains, and strengthen America’s national security.\n\nWe passed the #InflationReductionAct to create more than nine million good jobs here in America over the next decade and help us win the economic battle with China.\n\nWe fought this past year to fix supply chain problems, bring down costs for families, and grow our economy. That’s why I supported the CHIPS Act to invest in American manufacturing, the Ocean Shipping Reform Act to stop price gouging for shipping, and the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party is mad about the bill we passed to invest in American technology and manufacturing. They say it’s “discriminatory.” What they really mean is we’re beating their unfair advantage.

The Inflation Reduction Act is an investment in U.S. manufacturing because the jobs of the future should be here at home, not in China.\n\nThe CHIPS Act will strengthen our role as a global economic leader in semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nGrowing jobs in science and technology is important for our future and for working families right now. Our bipartisan CHIPS Act will crate jobs, fix supply chains, and lower costs for American families.\n\n Lower Food and Fuel Costs Act  Ocean Shipping Reform Act  CHIPs Act  Inflation Reduction Act\n\nDomestic production and manufacturing are key to quickly resolving supply chain backups.

This legislation will supercharge our science and tech economy and reduce costs for consumers. \n\nWith the bipartisan CHIPS Act, we can supercharge American science and technology research and create great new jobs for generations of Americans.\n\nI voted for the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act because we have an opportunity to end our dependence on foreign manufacturing and produce critical semiconductors right here in America.\n\nToday I voted for the CHIPS Act – that means new jobs, lower costs for consumers, and fixing supply chain issues on critical technology. This legislation is critical for our national security and our economy.\n\nI’m proud that my legislation, the Reclaiming the Solar Supply Chain Act, was included in the bipartisan America COMPETES Act.

I salute Congressman @michaelgwaltz's efforts to highlight the CCP's human rights abuses. \n\nIran’s illegal oil shipments to China skyrocketed by 40% in 2021 because of @POTUS’s lax enforcement of sanctions. Enforcement is critical to preventing the regime from paying off its terror proxies and engaging in uranium enrichment. \n\nWhile many talk about the China threat, @GovRonDeSantis is taking action by protecting our critical technology supply chains from the Chinese Communist Party. Bravo Zulu, Governor! \n\nI applaud @GovRonDeSantis for taking control of Florida’s pension portfolios that invest heavily in China. Florida should not be entangled with the Chinese Communist Party. \n\nOnce again China is bullying smaller nations into breaking off ties with Taiwan. This is a clear attempt to deteriorate Taiwanese sovereignty and another disturbing example of China’s aggressive diplomacy. \n\n.@POTUS's failed foreign policies have emboldened our advisories. 🚩Russia is threatening Ukraine’s sovereignty 🚩The Chinese Communist Party is threatening Taiwan’s sovereignty 🚩Iran is arming its terrorist proxies and expanding nuclear operations\n\nBoycotting the Chinese Winter Olympics is NOT political grandstanding. It’s standing up against human rights atrocities being committed by the Chinese Communist Party. The U.S. will not look the other way on the #CCP’s horrific human rights abuses. \n\nAmerica is 1 of only 7 nations worldwide that allows late-term abortions – putting us in the same company as China &amp; North Korea, countries with atrocious human rights records. It is time for the law to reflect the science. An unborn child is a human life. \n\nPresident Biden destroyed thousands of American energy jobs on day one. Now, @POTUS is asking China to release oil reserves. We need to invest in America and become energy independent again. \n\nWhen @POTUS abandoned our allies in Afghanistan, he set the tone for his administration. Russia and China’s recent provocative missile tests are a result of this administration’s show of weakness on the world stage. \n\nChina’s president effectively threatened the leader of the free world against defending Taiwan’s sovereignty. While this is unacceptable behavior, it also speaks volumes about the fact that our adversaries no longer fear us. \n\nTaxpayer money should never be used to fund Chinese gain of function research. I look forward to working with @RepJamesComer and my @GOPOversight colleagues as we continue to investigate why this occurred. Read my full statement here: \n\nThis news is deeply disturbing. While our military continues to preoccupy itself with domestic political distractions, the Chinese are developing weapons that put our competitive edge at risk. It's time to refocus our priorities. \n\nWhile China grows more aggressive by the day, the Biden Administration focuses on political optics and wordplay. The American people don’t care what our China strategy is called so long as it is effective in protecting our national security interests. \n\nIt should come as no surprise that China is engaging in this aggressive behavior now. The Biden Administration's foreign policy is in disarray. Our enemies sense our weakness and our allies are doubting our resolve. \n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

Read my latest op-ed below  \n\nThe Biden admin's decision to waive the IP rights of US businesses will have a chilling effect on innovation and serve as a massive giveaway to countries like China. @RepBuddyCarter and I led 49 of our colleagues calling on Biden to abandon this proposal. \n\nPleased to see the U.S. House pass legislation mirroring my proposal to help boost U.S. drug manufacturing and reduce our reliance on China and other nations for critical life-saving drugs. \n\nSince 2019, China has been lying about the scope and spread of COVID-19. That's why I’m backing a bill that 1⃣Allows Americans to sue China for coronavirus-related damages 2⃣Holds the WHO accountable for being complicit in China’s lies 3⃣Works to prevent future pandemics\n\nThat’s why I signed a letter calling for a full Congressional investigation into the source of COVID-19 and co-sponsored a bill to freeze financial aid to the WHO. The U.S. cannot trust, let alone contribute money to an organization that echoed China's lies to the world. \n\nTucked into President Biden’s record-breaking new budget proposal is a whopping $124 million dollars for the WHO, the same organization that helped China cover up the true origin and spread of the coronavirus from the American people. 1\/2\n\nthe Wuhan Institute of Virology, the only level 4 bio-agent lab in China.

I joined @MorningsMaria to discuss why Biden hasn’t condemned the Chinese Communist Party for their gross abuse of their citizens. \n\nThis Administration has done nothing to go after the Chinese Communist Party for unleashing COVID-19 on the world. I joined @AddisonSmithOAN on @OANN to discuss Biden’s weakness on the world stage. \n\nPleased to join @RepJimBanks on this legislation. It’s an important step in prioritizing our national security and countering the threat of China. \n\nLook no further than Afghanistan to see what type of military capabilities this Commander in Chief has. I joined @FoxFriendsFirst to discuss Biden’s weak foreign policy on China and Russia. \n\nCensoring our committee’s tweet about accountability speaks volumes for the length that the radical Left is willing to go to brainwash Americans into agreement–an action not unlike those taken by the Chinese Communist Party. \n\nThe Biden Admin’s disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal left $84 billion worth of military equipment &amp; weapons in the hands of terrorists. To make matters worse, there’s now a possibility that those weapons could end up being given to China &amp; Iran. I joined Victory News to discuss. \n\nI introduced the Protecting Our Land Act to block foreign adversaries like China, Russia, and Venezuela from purchasing U.S. land. My bill will curb malicious foreign activities on American soil and make America safer. \n\nWe wouldn’t be dealing with veiled threats from the Chinese if Trump was still president. Taiwan is a sovereign nation, and U.S. officials should go to any country they feel will aid in the development of the America First agenda. I joined @FoxNews @AmericaRpts to discuss. \n\nJoe Biden is not leading for the American people. His family is owned by China, and other foreign adversaries, and the Bidens are willing to sacrifice the prosperity of our great Nation for their personal economic gain. Now, the American people are paying the price.\n\nThe Democrats’ CHIPS bill could easily fund businesses operating in China. I joined @SpecialReport to discuss. \n\nI’ll be live with @LizMacDonaldFOX on @EveningEdit @FoxBusiness tonight to discuss China and Taiwan.

In Congress, I’ll continue fighting to end taxpayer funded experiments on dogs and other animals both here in the US and in foreign countries like Russia and China. \n\nI joined The Bob Rose Show to discuss how we can support American Agriculture against the threat of China. When Republicans take the majority, Congress will look intently at bringing manufacturing back to the US and protecting the domestic production of food and our supply chain. \n\n“The Biden admin should take into consideration pressing issues facing Americans like rising inflation, Chinese aggression &amp; the ongoing border crisis when sending money to support Ukraine during its conflict with Russia, according to Rep. Greg Steube.” \n\nWe have an invasion at our Southern border and record high inflation effecting OUR country, so why are we borrowing $40 billon from the Chinese to give to the Ukrainians? I joined @news_ntd to discuss. \n\nIs anyone home in the Biden Administration? YMTC, a Chinese semiconductor company appears to be violating US export controls while the Commerce Dept. and State Dept. do nothing. \n\nThe @PGATOUR is clearly a for-profit organization and should be treated as such. My legislation would close the special-interest loophole that allows PGA to avoid millions in taxes and hide its cozy relationship with China.

We need to sanction everyone doing business with the Russians. Thanks @Newsnationam for having me on to discuss. \n\nWhy won’t the Biden Administration utilize the congressionally approved sanctions on China and North Korea? I joined my @RepublicanStudy colleagues in asking for answers. \n\nChina is already prodding to see what the Biden Administration will let them get away with. I joined @SteveLanceNTD of @capitolreport to discuss how the Russian invasion could impact Taiwan. \n\nWhy is the Biden admin using the Russians and the Chinese to negotiate a deal with the Iranians – the largest state sponsor of terror in the world – to give them a path to nuclear war and allow the Russians to avoid Western sanctions? I joined @DanNewsManBall @OANN to discuss. \n\nJoe Biden must tell President Xi that if China gives weapons to Russia there will be real sanctions and repercussions. I don’t have a lot of faith in Joe Biden to do that today. I joined @FoxFriendsFirst to discuss. \n\nWhile everyone’s watching Russia, China has the most to gain here. Biden’s half-measured sanctions still allow China to do business with Russian banks. Why? \n\nOur allies and adversaries alike see that US leadership is nowhere to be found. First the Biden Admin steps aside for the Taliban, now Russia. The Taiwanese are rightly very worried.\n\nChina hasn’t held up their end of our trade agreement. Now China owes $16 billion to America’s farmers, ranchers, and agricultural producers. President Biden must take immediate action to ensure China pays their fair share. \n\nYou name it, we left it in Afghanistan. Not only did we leave Americans behind, but we left over $80 billion of equipment. If you see the leader of the free world do that with a terrorist organization, it emboldens our enemies like Russia and China to make their own moves. \n\nThe Biden Family is weak on China. Here’s why: @BreitbartNews @SiriusXMPatriot \n\nAs Congress deliberates Pelosi’s so-called “China bill”, the White House released a statement on the legislation without even mentioning the word CHINA! You can’t make this stuff up. \n\nPelosi’s “China” bill is 2900 pages long, does nothing to counter China &amp; will cost Americans BILLIONS. What’s she hiding in there?  ‼ $4 billion for the UN climate fund ‼ $100 billion for woke universities @RepublicanStudy’s bill will actually hold China accountable. \n\nWhile China mocks us for having #BigTech censor a president &amp; sitting members of Congress, they have hundreds of thousands of Uyghur Muslims in concentration camps.

Drones manufactured by Communist #China pose a threat to our national security whether at the U.S. Capitol or critical infrastructure sites across the nation. In Congress, I’m fighting so that we have the proper defense in place. \n\nCommunist China’s hold on U.S. ports and cranes poses a serious cyber-security threat. Earlier this year, I introduced the Port Crane Security and Inspection Act, which would prohibit the use of Chinese-made software in any crane connected to U.S. Ports. \n\nThis Cybersecurity Month, we raise awareness for such a vital aspect of our national security. Malign actors such as China, Russia, and Iran, engage in cyber warfare against Americans. I’m fighting to ensure our public and private assets have whatever they need to be protected. \n\nWe should NEVER allow the #CCP to buy American farmland. It jeopardizes both our food security and our national security. That's why I'm leading my colleagues in demanding action from the Biden administration on attempts by #China to buy our farmland. \n\nI led 51 of my colleagues in raising concerns over the #CCP purchasing farmland near U.S. military installations. #China actively augments its ability to spy on and disrupt our military. The Biden admin’s inaction jeopardizes our national security. \n\nIt was a pleasure to join the South Florida Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in their conversation on sustainability. I discussed how the U.S. is the global leader in reducing carbon footprint and the increasing threat of China. Thank you for having me. \n\nThe #CCP communists in Beijing persecute the Uyghurs, jail and kill political opponents, threaten Taiwan and Hong Kong, and actively support authoritarianism around the world. Speaker Pelosi’s message? “#China is one of the freest societies in the world.” Give me a break… \n\n#China is making the case for why the United States must maintain the military and economic edge in this great powers competition. The #CCP is making their challenge to American hegemony in the world public. For the sake of freedom and democracy, we cannot allow China to win.\n\nAmerica proudly stands with the people of Taiwan as they continue their struggle for freedom. #China continues to threaten Taiwan in the most despicable way. When the world faces a choice between freedom and tyranny, we must ALWAYS stand for freedom.  \n\nChina is an enemy of freedom. The #CCP is guilty of:  Butchery against the Uyghurs.  Suppression of #HongKong and #Taiwan.  Cyberattacks against critical infrastructure in the West.  Funding and abetting criminal dictators. Let’s stand AGAINST #China and FOR freedom.\n\nI stand with the people of Taiwan as they struggle against the tyranny of the #CCP. Taiwan is more of a friend to the United States than China ever will be.\n\nWho knew there were actually 11 commandments and that the missing one said “Thou shall not visit Taiwan?” \n\nAmerican’s are grappling with high gas prices and chaos at our border while Biden lifts tariffs and sends emergency oil to China. Nothing this administration does is in the best interest of America. Biden’s strategy is easy on China, hard on America. \n\nShinzo Abe was one of America’s greatest allies on the world stage, especially in the face of China’s growing global threat. He will always be remembered as a figurehead of freedom and a dear friend to the American people.  \n\nThe Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which I supported in the House, is now in effect. This law ensures U.S. businesses and consumers aren't a part of the slavery imposed on the #Uyghurs by the #CCP. It's time the world call #China out for this gross violation of human rights.\n\nI’m proud to stand with our allies in #Taiwan. We must deepen our relationship with Taiwan, both economically and militarily, as they continue to fight for freedom and democracy in the face of China’s growing threat. \n\nSaudi Arabia, which many Democrats are begging to pump more oil, is in cahoots with the communists in Beijing. China is NOT our friend. No more dependency on foreign oil, especially from foes such as Iran, Russia, and Venezuela. IT’S TIME TO BUY AND PRODUCE AMERICAN!  \n\nWhen one murderous autocrat is emboldened, so are all the others in the world. It's a domino effect. In the face of growing global tensions, Biden must reaffirm his steadfast and unequivocal support for Taiwan.\n\nKaepernick got endorsement deals and media clout for kneeling during the national anthem. Meanwhile, @EnesFreedom takes a career hit for exposing the atrocities committed by the #CCP. These pathetic double standards play right into China’s hands. WAKE UP!\n\nOne message to China: \n\nApparently it's being a Uyghur in China. #FreeTheUyghurs \n\n\"Imagine\" stopping the Uyghur genocide, leaving Taiwan alone, freeing Hong Kong, and ending communism. The whole world can stand #StrongerTogether for that. \n\nWelcome Team Taiwan!  \n\nCongress MUST investigate #China and the #CCP’s role in the proliferation of the COVID-19 pandemic. There MUST be accountability regarding the origins of the virus and the information they hid. We CANNOT let China off the hook.\n\nThe U.S. needs a Special Envoy to combat communism and authoritarianism. Cuba, Venezuela, and Nicaragua grapple with brutal communist dictatorships. Russia continues on the march into Ukraine. China threatens global stability and security. Meanwhile, Biden just sits passively.\n\nExtending a very warm welcome to Taiwan’s Vice President ⁦@ChingteLai⁩. #Taiwan is a crucial ally to the United States as we combat China’s malign behavior. I will always defend and stand with those on the side of freedom and democracy. \n\nAmerica first. Not:  Russia  The Taliban  China\n\nThe NBA should stop with such petty, wishy-washy PR statements and actually use their platform to call out the atrocities committed by China and the CCP. A big reason why I stopped watching the NBA a long time ago.\n\n7) Whether it’s Russia’s aggression towards Ukraine, the handling of Afghanistan or standing up to #China and the #CCP, Biden disappoints. You only achieve peace through strength and Biden continues to show weakness. #BidensFailures \n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

that has insufficient guardrails to protect billions of dollars of taxpayer funded research and development from being stolen\n\nThe CHIPS-Plus bill addresses a very important issue But it has a big loophole that could allow semiconductor manufacturers receiving taxpayer money to build chips in #China\n\nOur STATE leaders are the ones who rightfully fought Disney on a STATE issue I focus on REAL federal problems,like a ⁦@USDOT⁩ Secretary who believes in “racist highways”, supports $5 gas &amp;

I'm fighting to hold the CCP accountable for its evil human rights abuse, stealing intellectual property and spying on Americans.\n\nI agree &amp; will take it a step further: EVERY manufacturer relying on supply chains in Communist China must take a HARD STANCE against the evil treatment of Uyghur Muslims. Not a SINGLE AMERICAN dollar should be used to prop up the CCP's evil genocide. \n\nI was proud to join @SenTomCotton in introducing the NETWORKS Act, which cuts off tech companies controlled by Communist China who engage in economic espionage. The U.S. MUST hold these companies accountable for threatening our safety &amp; national security. \n\nTikTok's head of public policy REFUSES to acknowledge the CCP's brutal genocide of Uyghur Muslims, denies documents proving @tiktok_us shares data with Communist China &amp; dismisses the app's harmful impact on our kids. My advice? Delete TikTok ASAP. \n\nEverything the Communist Party of China does is BAD for America. Americans deserve the truth about #COVID19's origins and the CCP's role in spreading it. \n\nWARNING: Communist China is using #TikTok to spy on you and your children. Banning it is the ONLY way to protect YOUR privacy, family and our NATIONAL SECURITY. \n\nIn July, I visited Japan &amp; talked w\/ leaders about the threat posed by Communist China &amp; our shared commitment to stability through strength. Japan's commitment to boost defense spending over the next 5 years is great news for U.S. natl security &amp; our fight to defend freedom. \n\nCommunist China uses @tiktok_us to spy on Americans &amp; track every move you make. I'm proud our bill to ban #TikTok on gov't devices passed the Senate &amp; urge the House to do the same. We must do more to protect our national security &amp; keep the CCP from stealing information. \n\n.@JoeBiden is giving Communist China EXACTLY what they want by removing some Chinese entities from a red flag trade list. All while Xi and the CCP continue their human rights abuse and spying on Americans. It makes NO SENSE. Where's the accountability? \n\nIf Communist China wants to \"cooperate\" with the U.S., it can start by stopping its gross human rights abuses and respecting Taiwan. Biden has been quick to appease dictators like Xi, but he needs to make clear that until Communist China changes, there's nothing to discuss. \n\nCommunist China will do whatever is necessary to silence calls for freedom &amp; democracy in Hong Kong, even if it means sham convictions &amp; appalling human rights abuse. My good friend Jimmy Lai doesn't deserve this prison sentence. I proudly stand by him &amp; his calls for freedom.\n\nHistory will remember @Apple bending over backward to please the CCP while turning their backs on the Chinese people &amp; company employees. Every human deserves to be treated with dignity &amp; respect, &amp; that's all the Chinese people protestors want. \n\nThe @DeptofDefense's COVID-19 vax mandate impacts our military's readiness &amp; hinders recruitment. With increased aggression from Communist China and Russia, now is the time to bolster our military, not force them to comply with bureaucratic vax mandates. \n\nEverything Communist China does is an attempt to undermine the U.S., including forming a relationship with African leaders. Whether @JoeBiden is choosing to neglect his job or is unable to do it, it's no excuse. These leaders deserve to meet the president. \n\nThe brave protestors in China are fed daily propaganda by the Communist Party of China, and they STILL have a better understanding of the truth than the Biden admin. Communist China is an evil police state that can't be trusted. \n\n.@JoeBiden and woke CEOs are quick to speak out against everything but Communist China’s mistreatment of its citizens. What are they afraid of?\n\nBrave protesters are fighting for basic human rights and @Apple chooses to help the CCP SILENCE them. Apple must immediately reverse its decision to limit AirDrop and STOP cozying up to Communist China's murderous regime. \n\nIt's disturbing how companies like @Apple turn a blind eye to the mistreatment of the Chinese people yet jump at any opportunity to support @JoeBiden's woke agenda. Might be time to reconsider your priorities.\n\nCommunist China is our enemy, not our friend. It's time this administration started acting like it  \n\nCommunist China is our nation's top threat, so why isn't the admin acting like it? The Biden admin MUST completely and unashamedly admonish China's mistreatment of its citizens and stand with those demanding freedom.\n\n.@Apple is making it clear who they answer to  the Chinese Communist Party. Last summer, they ignored @FCC Commissioner Carr's request to remove TikTok because of \"serious national security threats,\" yet they are considering taking off Twitter without explanation. \n\nAllowing TikTok to operate in the United States isn't just a threat to our national security, it's a weapon the Chinese Communist Party uses to collect data on you and your kids. \n\nDespite the Chinese Communist Party's threats, the Chinese people are standing up against Xi and his evil regime. These brave protestors have EVERY right to demand freedom in the wake of inhumane repression.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party is an evil regime that will stop at nothing to maintain control. But no matter the opposition, the Chinese people should stand firm. The U.S. stands with those demanding freedom and fighting against this inhumane treatment. \n\nThe Chinese Communist Party will do whatever it takes to spy on Americans. We MUST pass my bill, the American Security Drone Act, to protect our national security &amp; your privacy by prohibiting the government from buying drones manufactured by our adversaries w\/taxpayer dollars. \n\nI refuse to stand by while the Chinese Communist Party sets up shop in the United States and targets its dissenters. Here's how I'm getting to the bottom of it  \n\nThe United States CANNOT allow the Chinese Communist Party to set up shop in our country and monitor Americans. It’s a matter of national security, and I’m getting to the bottom of it  \n\nEveryone should have the right to practice their religion freely, but for many around the globe, like the Uyghurs in Communist China, that isn't the case. (1\/2)\n\nFor years, I've been warning about the threat Chinese-based technology companies pose to our government. Xi and the Chinese Communist Party will stop at nothing in their mission for global dominance. We must take these threats seriously. \n\n🚨 WARNING TO U.S. BUSINESSES: Communist China cannot be trusted. I hope this is only the beginning of a strong crackdown by @TheJusticeDept. \n\nChinese activists are risking everything to demand change. We stand with them. \"We Want Bread, Not Covid Tests; We Want Freedom, Not Lockdowns. We Want Dignity, Not Lies. We Want Reform, Not Cultural Revolution. We Want Votes, Not a Great Leader; We are Citizens, Not Slaves.\" \n\nParents MUST BE CAUTIOUS. These apps are not just entertainment for your children; they're Communist China's way of feeding information to them. Don't be fooled. Protect your kids from being tracked by the CCP, and delete these apps NOW.\n\nTikTok and ByteDance are tools used by Communist China to spy, censor and target Americans. These apps CANNOT be trusted. That's why I joined @HawleyMO in fighting for legislation to bar federal employees from downloading or using these dangerous apps. \n\nThe Dept. of @Energy should prioritize Americans' best interests, not those of Communist China. I'm demanding answers as to why @JoeBiden is giving American businesses a cold shoulder while giving taxpayer-funded technology to companies in Communist China.\n\nThe CCP refuses to release its economic data, confirming what we knew all along: Communist China can't be trusted. That's why I introduced the Protect American Capital Act requiring the @USTreasury to report America's financial exposure in China annually.\n\n.@JoeBiden MUST immediately make clear to the world that the United States WILL NEVER bow to Communist China's evil. Read more  \n\n.@JoeBiden's CHIPS bill was a massive scam. @Intel got BILLIONS of your tax dollars and what's the return? More jobs in Communist China and fewer jobs here in the USA. \n\nOn #Taiwan's 111th National Day, we recognize its importance as a strong democracy &amp; trade partner. When I visited earlier this year, I saw Communist China's failed fear tactics as Xi flew sorties over us. America &amp; Taiwan won't be intimidated. We'll ALWAYS stand for freedom.\n\nIf true, @JoeBiden needs to immediately direct @TheJusticeDept to end any Communist Chinese police activity on U.S. soil &amp; to investigate this. @SecBlinken &amp; @NYCMayor also need to tell us what they're doing to crack down &amp; stop this NOW. \n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

We will move supply chains away from China &amp; expand domestic manufacturing. It’s past time our country put America, and Americans, first. #CommitmenttoAmerica\n\nThanks to Biden, China is adding to its oil reserves with oil from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve. And this week, House Dems blocked a vote to prevent the sale of U.S. oil to Communist China. This is the Democrats America LAST policy! \n\nIf @POTUS sending barrels of oil from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve to China wasn’t bad enough, this week he’ll travel to beg Saudi Arabia to export more oil. Biden’s America LAST energy policy is on full display &amp; it’s absolutely appalling. \n\nBiden sending oil from the United States Strategic Petroleum Reserve overseas smells to high heaven. While Americans are paying record high prices at the pump, this administration decides to give our oil to the EU and China. \n\nLet me get this straight: Biden bans energy imports from Russia yet works out an oil deal with Venezuela (allied with Russia and China). Instead of kowtowing to communist nations, @POTUS Joe Biden needs to open up our own resources and unleash a cleaner American energy supply.\n\nBiden claims he wants to buy and manufacture in America yet he purchases Chinese products…? Masks provided in Pelosi’s House  \n\nThe Democrats’ China legislation is the latest example of their America Last agenda. Conceding to the CCP will do nothing to make the U.S. more competitive or improve our trade agenda. It's clear all of these far Left policies will only make our nation more vulnerable to China. \n\nThe Taliban, China, Russia, drug cartels, criminal gangs, &amp; liberal elites are all building back better under the Biden Administration’s reckless policies. For Joe Biden and Democrats, it's everybody first—except America More of my views in @FoxNews ↓ \n\nWATCH 🚨 It is revealing that there are @WaysMeansCmte Democrats who think it’s a good idea to give America's intellectual property to China.

While Democrats refuse to investigate the origins of COVID-19, @SteveScalise, @RepJamesComer, and @HouseGOP won't let China get away with this. Americans deserve answers. \n\n.@GOPLeader, @HouseGOP &amp; @GOPDoctors are committed to holding China accountable for COVID-19. Determining the origin of the virus shouldn't be a partisan issue, yet Democrats continue to stonewall. Here's our plan to keep the pressure on finding the truth: \n\nBetween President Biden’s budget &amp; Congressional Democrats’ drug pricing proposal, American innovation is on the brink of bowing to China. Their radical proposals will directly lead to fewer cures &amp; open the door for jobs being sent overseas. Watch more from @WaysandMeansGOP ↴ \n\nWhy does America need a domestic availability waiver to allow us to buy masks from China when we have 260 million American made masks sitting in warehouses? It’s time to support American manufacturers and #BuyAmerican! \n\nIn March, I warned @POTUS that heavy reliance on China for PPE would hurt American small businesses &amp; urged him to apply the Berry Amendment. Domestically sourced PPE is necessary for pandemic preparedness &amp; national security. It's time to #BuyAmerican. \n\nBiden’s policies will kill American innovation. This patent waiver undermines our intellectual property, ultimately benefiting China in their ongoing campaign to violate foreign IP regs.

With China conducting military drills off Taiwan’s coast, they need us more than ever.\n\nAt a time when Taiwan is facing unprecedented pressure from China, Biden is reportedly pressuring Democrats not to provide further security aid and support its status internationally…\n\n[1\/2] Releasing 1 million barrels of oil per-day from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve was never the answer to historic gas prices, but sending our reserves to countries like China, Italy, and the Netherlands… \n\nUnited States 8.6% Canada 7.7% Mexico 7.6% Germany 7.6% Italy 7.8% France 5.8% South Korea 5.4% Japan 2.5% China 2.1% \n\n[1\/2] Democrat’s #CONCEDESact further blocks domestic mining projects, and oil and gas leasing sales, which increases our reliance on foreign countries like China.\n\nDemocrat’s #CONCEDESact mentions climate change more than twice as often as national security.

Chinese fentanyl from Mexican cartels kills them more than Covid, Cancer, heart disease, and all other accidents. \n\nChinese fentanyl trafficked across our southern border by Mexican cartels is murdering Americans &amp; Biden refuses to stop it. Fentanyl poisoning deaths are up nearly 300% in GA! Hear emergency room doctor &amp; incoming freshmen GA Rep @RichforGA on why we must secure our border. \n\nDrugs are killing Georgians but Chinese fentanyl coming from Mexican cartels is murdering them, and Biden’s border crisis is to blame. Drug overdose deaths in Georgia increased by 55.9% from 2019 to 2021. From 2019 to 2021, fentanyl-involved overdose deaths increased by 218.4%!\n\nHolding China accountable and protecting America in every way from Chinese fentanyl killing Americans, China buying our farmland, supply chain, to the dangers of the CCP. Having a Republican House Speaker on these issues are incredibly important to conservatives. \n\nWhat kind of thanks do the American people get from their hard earned tax dollars sent and spent in foreign aid all over the world? We get deadly fentanyl from China smuggled in by the Mexican international terrorists cartels as the number 1 cause of death among young Americans.\n\nJoe forces America to rejoin the climate cult while China ramps up use of coal powered energy and is the top buyer of America’s oil that Joe sells out of our Strategic Petroleum Reserve. I can hear the applause now when Americans can no longer run their heat in the winter. \n\nThe NDAA requires just a briefing if China buys land near our US military installations, but does NOT prohibit China from buying land near our military installations. In other words, just write a report when China buys land by the base but don’t bother stopping them.\n\nThe CCP has abused China’s people long enough. Covid has been an evil tool of oppression. It started in Wuhan, it ends in Wuhan. I’m praying for these people. \n\nWhen tyrannical leaders become dictators for life this can’t have a good outcome. Praying for the people in China. \n\nThat’s the fentanyl seized by @CBP at closely monitored ports of entry, NOT the rest of our WIDE-OPEN BORDER. This is what’s caught, not the Chinese-made fentanyl flooded into America by Mexican cartel drug mules. We’re not taking the open-border Cato Institute seriously. \n\nMexican cartels and drug dealers control the southern border. 300 Americans DIE EVERY SINGLE DAY from Chinese fentanyl the Mexican cartels traffic across our border. Joe Biden does nothing. Biden is the best business partner the cartels will ever have &amp; enemy of America.\n\nHow did teams assigned to covid vaccine creation, like China’s military virologist Zhou Yusen, create a vaccine in an unrealistic time frame? Why did American media spew China’s talking points &amp; why did Big Tech censor anyone going against them? Talk about a Big Lie..\n\nWhy would U.S. tax dollars ever go to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, where China’s top coronavirus researchers were playing Dr. Frankenstein with coronavirus strains to see which ones might become most infectious to humans? Oh, but the wet market.. 1\/2 \n\nLastly Joe, while you’re attacking me for legally doing the same thing millions of Americans did, trying to financially survive a government forced economic shutdown before I was even a Member of Congress, I’m now preparing to investigate your ILLEGAL business deals with China.\n\nThe Biden crime family wheeled and dealed with CCP reps to buy &amp; sell America’s gas reserves BEFORE Biden was POTUS. Biden proved to be such a good CCP ally they urged him to run for president. Now Joe sells our SPR to China. Joe Biden is China First and America Last! \n\nGermany is using coal power again and abandoning climate scam energy while promising to end coal by 2030. Just like China is burning more coal than ever while promising to be carbon net zero by 2050. Face it, fossil fuels like coal actually keep the lights on and houses warm.\n\nhe is serving China and securing their economic power by forcing the US into complete dependence on the China controlled EV battery industry. All while funding a proxy war with nuclear Russia and purposely allowing a world invasion across our borders.\n\nAnd China controls nearly all of the rare earth mineral mines and the battery industry. America does not even compete, we have less than 5% of the market share. So not only is Biden dangerously draining our SPR putting us all in a national security crisis,\n\nBiden is willfully allowing the daily invasion of our southern border and Chinese fentanyl is killing an average of 300 Americans per day. Fentanyl kills every identity and does not discriminate. Mayorkis is also willfully allowing the murder of Americans. Impeach them both!\n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

We're failing on the latter part.\" I spoke in support of H.Res.1378 in today's @NatResources markup. We must meet our critical mineral needs and stop our dependence on Russia and China. \n\n ICYMI - I joined the @KevinMillerShow on Tuesday to discuss the recently passed CHIPS Act, the raid on Mar-a-Lago, and the lawsuit filed against Idaho. Listen here: \n\nWhile we cannot understate the risk currently posed by China’s position in the semiconductor market, we also should not understate the current devastating effects of inflation – which is further exacerbated by more spending. Read my full statement  \n\nThank you to @RepKenBuck &amp; @RepJimBanks for your leadership on these bills to sanction and cut off U.S. funds from supporting the genocide and crimes against humanity happening against Uyghurs in the Xinjiang region of China. \n\nIn light of the World Health Organization's serious lapses in transparency regarding its relationship to China at the outset of COVID-19, it is clear that the organization is falling short of its mission to protect global public health. It is time to defund the WHO. \n\nThe Stibnite project in Idaho represents the largest reserve of antimony outside of Russia or China, and could supply 35% of U.S. demand within the first six years of operation. But the bill proposed by Democrats today in @NatResources threatens the viability of this project. \n\nWhat unites China &amp; Russia is a reciprocal need for natural resources — and a common grievance with the US. Nevertheless, it would be surprising to see China discourage trade with the US’ $21 Trillion economy for Russia’s $1.5 Trillion alternative. \n\nI joined 120 House Republican colleagues in a letter to Speaker Pelosi expressing disbelief over the House issuing \"Made in China\" masks to members and staff. This is a fitting analogy to the confusing COVID response from the Biden Administration: \n\nThe Chinese Communist Party hopes to use the 2022 Beijing Olympics as a propaganda tool to gloss over their continued human rights abuses against Uyghurs and religious miniorites. Don’t let them. Let’s make this year’s games the #LeastWatchedOlympics \n\nA recent report by the Foundation For Defense of Democracies makes clear that the Chinese Communist Party is using U.S. universities to support China’s military-industrial complex. It is imperative that our institutions of higher ed heed this warning: \n\nA minimum tax on U.S. companies will harm American consumers. President Biden's proposed tax on anything \"Made in America\" will ensure that more of our everyday items are made in China. Read more about this bad tax plan here: \n\nJust as important as “what’s in the bill?” is “what’s not in the bill?” Democrats have removed a provision in the previous draft of the reconciliation bill that prevents taxpayer dollars from going to entities using Uyghur Muslim slaves in China. \n\nProud of our state for this accomplishment! Critical minerals are vital to our country's national security. The Biden Administration is transitioning our country to rely on foreign countries like China for these products-- we are working in @NatResources to prevent this. \n\nDemocrats have BLOCKED GOP amendments to:  Prohibit critical minerals from China and the Taliban  Prohibit critical minerals mined using child &amp; slave labor  Prohibit grants to entities controlled by the CCP Read more about this reckless plan: \n\nI am cosponsoring the bipartisan Stop Forced Organ Harvesting Act to hold China accountable after growing evidence of heinous, state-sanctioned acts of organ harvesting. Read more about the legislation here: \n\nand against the people of Hong Kong. I have voted to implement sanctions against Chinese government officials who engage in policies that violate basic human rights and steal from American companies. These actions will not be forgotten. 2\/2\n\nOn this day 32 years ago, China cracked down on students demonstrating for basic freedoms in Tiananmen Square in Beijing. Today, China continues to suppress basic freedoms, not only in its own country and against its own people, but against ethnic and religious minorities 1\/2\n\nThe Endless Frontier Act, sponsored by Democrat Chuck Schumer, spends $112 billion on technology development yet blatantly ignores the necessary steps to prevent China from stealing American Intellectual Property. I join @RepublicanStudy in opposing this policy.\n\nHigher taxes than Communist China? That’s not a delayed April Fool’s joke, that is the reality under President Biden’s proposed tax plan. \n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

The bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 243-187. The bill will now be presented to the President to be signed into law. \n\nChina’s goals of trade &amp; military dominance are a threat to the U.S. &amp; we should not neglect our policies of countering China’s aggressive &amp; reckless trade, health, human rights, &amp; military practices. Like many in Congress, I support efforts to send a strong message to China.\n\nThere is no better time than now to take real action to prioritize domestic sourcing and to reduce our reliance on Russia and China.

Rather than inviting them into our backyard, we should be strategically decoupling from them. \n\nNorth Dakota and Taiwan share a Sister State relationship and today’s agreement to purchase more than $3.2 billion dollars of corn, soybeans, and wheat from the U.S. in the next two years strengthens it.

You’d have to be naïve not to believe the Chinese are up to something with an investment so close to the base. \n\nI joined 25 of my Senate colleagues in supporting @SpeakerPelosi’s trip to Taiwan. Members of Congress have been visiting Taiwan for decades and we are committed now, more than ever, to our Taiwanese allies and the Taiwan Relations Act. \n\nI’m opposed to the semiconductor legislation on the Senate floor this week.

From both a national security and agricultural standpoint, the Chinese buying farmland close to the @319thRW is a problem. I trust the review results will share my concerns. \n\nDiscussed my opposition to Fufeng's farmland purchase near @319thRW on @foxandfriends.

China has been a predatory investor for a long time. We need to find ways to strategically decouple ourselves from China, not more ways to bring them in.

I also encouraged the Biden Administration to keep Section 301 tariffs on China. Watch  \n\nThe President’s comments are doubly confusing when he touts support for Taiwan while leaving them out of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. It’s too bad @POTUS didn’t heed our bipartisan advice stressing the importance of Taiwan’s inclusion. \n\nWhether he meant to say it or not, the President’s commitment to defend Taiwan was the right position. Unfortunately, the “Administration” doesn’t support what the President said. Taiwan needs clear messaging from whoever is in charge at the White House. \n\nWatch my opening statement at today’s Seapower Subcommittee hearing. @POTUS’ defense budgets for @USNavy and @USMC are inadequate and concerning. Bottom line: this budget sends China and other potential adversaries the wrong message. \n\nReplenishing our Stinger stockpile is welcome news as we protect ourselves, help Ukraine, and while Taiwan is still waiting for their order. The situation in Ukraine is a reminder to be proactive vs. reactive to threats around the world. \n\nMet with @USNavy Admiral Michael Gilday and discussed the recently released budget, force priorities, and the status of our allied partnerships.

The President’s announcement today of the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework is a welcome step to get us back in the game, but the framework leaves much to be desired.\n\nSomehow, the depravity of the Chinese Communist Party continues to hit new lows.

Now they are torturing #Uyghur children! \n\nThe Democrats just passed their weak ‘China’ bill that doesn’t take the threat posed by the #CCP seriously, doesn’t use our most potent foreign policy tools, and dumps billions into the UN’s climate slush fund. Watch my full statement opposing the bill: \n\nAs the House considers the so-called #China competition bill, it’s important to note what wasn’t debated. Democrats refused to allow debate on the Asia Subcmte GOP amd’t as an alternative to Dem policy. @RepKenBuck, @RepTimBurchett, @RepMarkGreen, @RepAndyBarr &amp; @RepYoungKim \n\nThe Biden Administration’s statement supporting Speaker Pelosi’s so-called #China bill doesn’t even mention the word “China.” This just underscores the fact that Washington Democrats are more worried about upsetting the #CCP than standing up for American interests. \n\nAs part of the legislative process, the House Rules Committee holds a hearing to prepare a bill for Floor debate and consider amendments.

President Biden’s botched withdrawal may allow an enemy we’ve fought for the last 20 years – the Taliban – to hand over a U.S. military base to our top competitor in the next 20 years — #China. \n\nA new report from @HouseForeignGOP contains the strongest evidence yet that #COVID leaked from a Wuhan lab by mid-September 2019 - a leak China knew about &amp; covered up. The whole world deserves to know what #China knew &amp; when. \n\nAs Co-Chair of the Taiwan Caucus, I applaud House adoption of an amendment I offered with @RepTiffany to the State Dept. funding bill that would prevent State from buying\/making\/displaying maps that show #Taiwan as part of #China. \n\nAs Ranking Member on the Asia-Pacific Subcommittee, @RepBera and I held a joint subcommittee hearing w\/ the Subcommittee on Europe, Energy, the Environment and Cyber on U.S. cooperation with Europe on China and the broader Indo-Pacific. Watch my questions: \n\nAs evidenced by the flurry of recent #ransomware attacks, we must step up our cybersecurity efforts and hold those who perpetrate such crimes accountable. This includes the #CCP. #China \n\nCommittee Democrats rejected nearly all key Republican amendments to strengthen the bill, including a package I offered to support Taiwan by giving their government the respect they deserve, and combatting the #PRC’s malign influence there. Learn more: \n\nThis week, the House Foreign Affairs Committee passed the EAGLE Act, the House Democrat’s partisan China bill. As the Asia-Pacific Subcommittee’s top Republican, I opposed the bill, because it doesn’t effectively rise to the challenge posed by the #CCP’s bid for global dominance.\n\nI offered one of the amendments that passed which would counter the PRC’s economic warfare, their practice of leveraging economic ties to keep countries silent on human rights, #Taiwan, and the origins of #COVID. Watch for more details: \n\nTomorrow, @HouseForeignGOP will vote on more amendments to the EAGLE Act, the House Democrats’ China bill. So far, my Democratic colleagues have agreed to a few Republican amendments which will improve the bill, but the legislation still needs significant changes.\n\nToday, @HouseForeignGOP begins postponed amendment votes on the Democrats’ China bill - the EAGLE Act. ICYMI, you can watch my remarks from the beginning of the debate describing why we need a tougher response to China than what this bill offers: \n\nMy sixth amendment to the #China bill expresses our support for freedom of expression for everyone across the globe.\n\nMy amendment highlights the fact that in China, there is no freedom of the press. We saw this poignantly in #HongKong last week with the shutdown of #AppleDaily, the last pro-democracy newspaper in the city. And that’s just one example of the PRC’s efforts to censor the press.\n\nMy fifth amendment to the #China bill expresses support for #PressFreedom in China and around the globe. As Co-Chair of the Freedom of the Press Caucus, I know that a free and independent press is necessary to help citizens hold their government leaders accountable.\n\nMy fourth amendment to the #China bill would drive cooperation with the British and Australians on export controls, which are critical to countering the PRC.\n\nMy fourth, fifth and sixth amendments to the #China bill were adopted by the Foreign Affairs Committee as part of a package of amendments.\n\nMy third amendment to the #China bill would require the President to develop a whole-of-government strategy to counter the PRC’s master plan to emerge as the world’s dominant economic power, and build a global economy centered on Beijing.\n\nJust offered my second amendment to the #China bill, which would remove a reference to executive agreements (Three Joint Communiques) in the bill, preserving congressional silence on these agreements &amp; ensuring the Taiwan Relations Act remains the guiding law on #Taiwan policy.\n\nThe amendment also includes several additional provisions to help bolster #Taiwan’s defense and improve relations and trade between our two nations.\n\nThese provisions include language to pay the proper respect to #Taiwan as a sovereign nation, and to reaffirm our opposition to any use of force by the PRC against Taiwan.\n\nJust offered my first amendment to the #China bill, to re-insert pro-Taiwan language that had been approved by the Senate, but was left out of the House bill.\n\nToday, the Foreign Affairs Comm. is considering the Democrats’ bill on China - the EAGLE Act. Because the bill fails to meet its primary objective (standing up to the PRC), I can’t support it as currently written. But, I’m offering several amendments to improve the final product.\n\nI think we need to be careful that we aren't restricting the ability of American companies to compete with China. Instead, our focus should be more on protecting American companies and consumers from the harmful activities emanating from the Communist Chinese government.\n\nToday #AppleDaily, Hong Kong’s last pro-democracy newspaper, printed its final edition after aggressive gov’t harassment. As Co-Chair of the Freedom of the Press Caucus, I’m appalled by China’s attacks on the press &amp; the people of Hong Kong. #freehongkong \n\nAfter joining @RepAndyBarr on a letter last month urging the Administration to send vaccines to Taiwan, I welcome the delivery of 2.5 million doses this weekend: \n\nGreat to discuss shared Indo-Pacific concerns with senior German diplomats, State Secretary @MiguelBergerAA and @GERonAsia Director-General for Asia and the Pacific Petra Sigmund. A unified approach with our allies is critical to facing the region’s challenges, especially China. \n\nToday marks the 32nd Anniversary of the #TiananmenSquare Massacre. We must not forget the innocent victims or countless other victims of the same Chinese Communist Party repression, including those in #HongKong and Xinjiang today.

How many more American lives must we lose before this administration takes action to secure our border and #StopTheCartels? \n\nThe future of money is the most important public policy debate in western civilization. #SoundMoney is essential to defend freedom, but the Biden Administration and the Bank of International Settlement seem focused on copying China’s Communist Party. \n\nDemocrats prevented us from even offering an amendment that would have prohibited grant recipients from making new investments into China for five years. They like the subsidies and aren’t even serious about national security.\n\nTo help a few winners, this bill sticks hard-working Americans with another bill for the Swamp’s refusal to hold China accountable for abusive trade practices, theft of intellectual property, blocking of market access, and horrible human rights abuses.\n\nLast week we saw that nobody loves big government like big business.

With the new Intel semiconductor facility coming to Ohio, it is critical that the #CHIPSAct receive full funding. We must increase domestic chip production to maintain our national security. \n\nThe United States cannot afford to weaken our position on the world stage, especially against our Russian and Chinese adversaries. Ending our nuclear modernization program while they improve theirs is a threat to our national security. \n\nA week has passed since I called for classified briefing on the call between Biden and Xi. As the war continues to rage and Russia continues to attack civilians in Ukraine, there is great concern as to what Russia and China will be doing, as they move closer together. \n\nThe call between President Biden and President Xi contained critical information relevant to the future of U.S.-China relations and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, which is why I have requested a classified briefing on the details of this call. \n\n🚨TUNE IN!

It’s time for Congress to tend to the serious business of American competitiveness on the world stage. \n\nWhat should have been bipartisan legislation focused on making the United States competitive against China and reducing our dependence on Asia for semiconductor chips, ballooned to a $300 billion liberal wish list packed full of Green New Deal priorities. [2\/3]\n\nLifting tariffs on Chinese-made solar panels defies common sense, rewards cheating, and is bad for American workers. Today, I joined my colleague @boblatta and others demanding that the Biden Administration reverse course on this disastrous decision. \n\nBoosting Chinese solar imports is somehow making the U.S. \"clean energy independent\"? China is \"eating our lunch,\" Mr. @POTUS. \n\nFor Putin, natural gas is about more than money, it’s about leverage. And Xi is taking notes. China currently makes 80% of the world’s polysilicon used in solar. We cannot allow ourselves to fall victim to Europe’s same fate. #EnergyIndependence \n\nAsian countries now account for more than 70 percent of semiconductor #chips manufacturing globally. We cannot allow ourselves to be held hostage by the imbalance of foreign chip production. It’s past time to bolster this production here at home.\n\nSince the early 1990s, the U.S. share of #CHIPS manufacturing has fallen from 37 percent to just 12 percent today. Falling further behind in chip manufacturing is a national security issue that we just can’t afford. \n\nChinese fentanyl pouring over the border contributed to the deaths of more than 64,000 Americans between May 2020 and April 2021. It's past time to stop relying on China for help. The Administration must step up and address the crisis at the border NOW. \n\nThe recent @intel announcement puts Licking County at the epicenter of a new Silicon Heartland and at the forefront of addressing the nation’s semiconductor shortage. Let's get rid of the mountain of unrelated add-ons, and get the #ChipsAct across the finish line! \n\nThe CHIPS Act presents Congress a golden opportunity to FINALLY pass a bipartisan, common-sense investment to bolster American competitiveness on the world stage. Unfortunately, the CHIPS Act constitutes a small fraction of the bill’s overall price tag, which is over $300B. \n\nHouse Democrats are again pushing a bill that is TOO BIG, TOO COSTLY, and TOO PARTISAN. I support the #CHIPSAct, but - sadly - it only constitutes a small fraction of their bill's +$300 BILLION price tag. \n\nInstead of fanning the flames of anti-Semitism, @amnesty should focus on real human rights abusers like the Chinese Communist Party. This baseless demonization of Israel is appalling. \n\nChina is investing big money to soften criticism of its human rights abuses during the #WinterOlympics2022. \n\nSpeaker Pelosi’s Capitol Hill mask mandate now comes with a complimentary KN95 emblazoned with MADE IN CHINA.  No thank you, Madam Speaker. I support MADE IN THE USA!  \n\nToday's passage of our Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act sends a strong message to Chinese Communist Party leadership that the U.S. will not turn a blind eye to its human rights abuses. \n\nGenocide and forced labor sanctioned by the Chinese Communist Party are an affront to, not just the Chinese people, but to civilized nations everywhere. I'm calling on Congress to ban the import of Chinese goods made with forced Uyghur labor. \n\nChina's increasing influence over mineral mines presents a serious threat to American manufacturers. That's why I supported common-sense language, rejected by House Democrats, establishing Buy America requirements for DOT-funded charging stations. \n\nCapitulation and timidity in the face of authoritarian regimes should never be accepted as the new norm of American foreign policy. President Biden must make clear that the United States stands by our ally Taiwan. \n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

With the CHIPS and Science Act now law, we're making more in America and creating good-paying jobs in the process.\n\nThe Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, Inflation Reduction Act, &amp; CHIPs Act are already paying off for Ohio. From EVs, batteries, to semiconductors — the future will be made in Ohio by Ohio workers. \n\n90% of the world's natural rubber comes from Asia. That's a recipe for disaster. I'm proud to have secured $5 million to support Ohio farmers, business, &amp; our military who are working to end our dangerous dependence on China, reshore our supply chain &amp; bolster national security. \n\nManufacturing is in our blood in Ohio. With investments on the way from legislation like the CHIPs Act &amp; Inflation Reduction Act, we're finally getting back to what we do best. We're creating a future we can be proud of — and rebuilding the great American middle class.\n\nOver the last two years, we’ve seen over 150,000 jobs created across Ohio. With investments coming from the CHIPS Act and Inflation Reduction Act, we’re positioning our manufacturing sector to come back stronger than ever before. \n\nOur Inflation Reduction Act is the start of an industrial policy in the United States that will allow us to go toe-to-toe with China, creating jobs and lowering costs for working families in the process. Let’s keep going.\n\nThanks to our CHIPS Act, Intel’s historic investment in Ohio is going to get us back to what we do best: making things, powering our nation, and strengthening the great American middle class. \n\nWith legislation like the CHIPS Act and Inflation Reduction Act, we’re creating a brighter future for our kids by investing in the industries that will make Ohio a center of opportunity now and for generations to come.\n\n CHIPS &amp; Science Act  Lower Food &amp; Fuels Costs Act  Consumer Fuel Price Gouging Prevention Act  Affordable Insulin Now Act  Inflation Reduction Act I won't stop fighting to give you &amp; your family the breathing room you've earned.\n\nI'm calling on @POTUS to expand Buy American rules to bolster domestic solar manufacturing. There’s no reason we should be relying on any other nation—especially not China—to power our government when we have the best workers and manufacturers here in Ohio ready to go. \n\nOur #CHIPSAct has been signed into law! It’s a transformational investment in semiconductor production that’s going to create thousands of good-paying jobs at home, rebuild our manufacturing base, and allow us to outcompete China. Ohio leading America once again. \n\nPhenomenal news. Voltage valley is electrifying our local economy and bringing supply chains home. These initiatives, along with the CHIPS Act, are going to position our region to be leaders in the economy of the future. \n\nRebuilding our manufacturing base. Creating thousands of good-paying jobs. Outcompeting China. Strengthening national security. If we can't agree on this, what the hell can we agree on? \n\n🚨 We passed the CHIPS Act! I want to thank @Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger for his faith in Ohio, JP Nauseef and his incredible team @JobsOhio, the phenomenal crew at Columbus Partnership, and our hardworking union partners who will build Intel. America 2.0. We're on our way. \n\nI’ve been calling on Congress to pass the CHIPS Act for months now. Today we’ll finally take up this legislation that’s going to have a seismic impact on American manufacturing, fix our supply chains, and best of all—put Ohio workers on top. \n\nIt’s time for Congress to pass the CHIPS Act to bring our supply chain back home and give American workers a fighting chance at dominating the industries of the future. The clock is ticking.\n\nMy colleagues and I are also asking the Administration why they chose to overlook certain Chinese solar companies suspected of forced labor. No excuse to do business with a foreign company potentially exploiting slave labor when we have American workers &amp; businesses ready to go.\n\nThe United States cannot stand by as the Chinese Communist Party tries to flood our markets with goods made by forced labor &amp; harm American workers in the process. That's why I'm calling on the Biden Administration to aggressively enforce the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. \n\nMitch McConnell is holding Ohio’s economy hostage. It’s time to put partisan politics aside and do what’s right to ensure Ohio’s new semiconductor industry can deliver good-paying jobs and help our nation compete against China. \n\nThe @EPA's ban on steel cylinders made at @WorthingtonInds would give the Chinese Communist Party a free pass to undercut American business and risks putting 400 Ohioans out of a job. Bad for business and worse for our workers. I won’t stop fighting this until it’s fixed. \n\nI'm introducing a bill today to expand Buy American rules on solar products. If we want to meet our climate goals, put Ohio workers first, and dominate the industries of the future, we must close the loopholes that enable the Chinese Communist Party's abusive trade practices. \n\nICYMI: Last week, I sent a letter to @POTUS urging him to keep trade tariffs on China in place. Bottom line: We can’t reward a human rights abusing government for years of cheating our trade laws and undermining our workforce. We must put American workers and businesses first. \n\nI’m joining my colleagues today to urge that @POTUS support an investigation into unfair Chinese trade practices to protect our workers and the future of American energy independence. \n\nThe United States leads the world in solar technology innovation, yet 80% of the world’s solar panels are currently made in China. Why? Predatory Chinese trade practices that have cheated American solar manufacturers and American workers.\n\nFor the first time since 1976, The United States’ annual economic growth is set to outpace China’s. Let’s keep this momentum going by continuing to invest in domestic manufacturing, training our workforce for the future, and developing new technologies here at home. \n\nAmerica used to dominate manufacturing and now we’re asleep at the wheel while countries like China run circles around us. We can lead again, but only if we set working people up to succeed and invest in the middle class like never before.\n\nAmerica can’t stay asleep at the wheel while the Chinese government runs circles around us. \n\nLike I've done my entire career, I will fight against any move—by either political party—that incentivizes predatory trade practices that put China ahead of our workers.\n\nLifting tariffs on China would be a major mistake. It would do nothing to ease inflationary pressures on American consumers and instead reward a human-rights abusing, communist government for years of cheating American workers and stealing jobs. \n\nOhioans remember when state-subsidized Chinese manufacturers led to the closure of the Huffy Bicycle Plant in Celina, OH (loss of 600+ jobs). Just one of many examples in Ohio. \n\n\"Why do we have tariffs on bicycles or apparel or underwear?\" Because China’s communist government subsidizes its manufacturing industry in order to bankrupt American companies and steal their market share. \n\nI'm grateful for such phenomenal partners in @EPAMichaelRegan and @SenSherrodBrown to ensure that every Ohioan has the opportunity to thrive in their communities, no matter their zip code. In a competition of a lifetime with China and the rest of the world, this is priority #1. \n\nToday, @POTUS announced he will require US-made iron and steel for infrastructure. After years of disinvestment, jobs shipped overseas, and losing to China, this is our chance to put America's workers and future first. It's what @SenSherrodBrown and I have been fighting for. \n\nMake no mistake. The Chinese government is an accomplice to Putin's slaughter of innocent Ukrainians. They have the power to stop this, but they refuse. \n\nOur dangerous dependence on manufacturing from China is costing us. Another reason why we need to immediately pass the COMPETES Act and invest in the innovation that's going to put American workers back on top. \n\nThis @Intel deal could bring up to $100 billion for Ohio workers, for good-paying jobs, and for our economy by just the end of this decade. A game changer for Ohio in our competition with China. All we need to do is pass the America COMPETES Act into law. Let’s get it done. \n\nWe need to stand up for our workers and manufacturers, invest in good-paying jobs here at home, and rebuild American energy independence. If we don't do this, we only become more dependent on China, and China wins. That's not an option.\n\nChina is dominating LED lightbulb production. That’s not just bad for Ohio and U.S workers—it’s a national security issue. That’s why I wrote text in the DoD spending bill to require LED bulbs purchased by the DoD to be made here in the US. Congressional Republicans blocked it. \n\nThis is what the world looks like if China and Russia are leading global institutions. America must lead. \n\nWhen we talk about why America needs to be exceptional and always at our best, it’s because if we are not leading the world, it will be led by China and Russia. And we see every minute what that looks like. Please get Ukraine the planes, @POTUS. (2\/2)\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party must answer for every single one of their crimes and wrongdoings. I join my colleagues in urging @POTUS to stand against China’s acts of genocide, repeated human rights abuses, and trade law violations that hurt competition and cheat American workers. \n\nInflation and rising costs are crushing our manufacturing workers. We need to be backing them now more than ever if we’re going to compete against Russia and China. Congress needs to pass a tax cut for the people carrying the economy on their backs. Now. \n\nWe aren't going to outcompete China and Russia without a strong national defense. That's why I’m proud to have helped secure key wins for our military, including:  A pay raise for our troops  Funding for new @USAFReserve aircraft  $8.7 million for YARS &amp; much more.\n\nTotal BS. Communist China knows exactly what they're doing by playing footsie with Russia as they continue their all-out invasion of Ukraine. We're making a big mistake if we don't recognize that and hold them accountable for it. \n\nGreat meeting with company officials and @smartlocal33 workers at the @SodexoRoth facility in Youngstown. These workers, right here in the heart of #VoltageValley, are on the cutting edge of industries that are going to help us win the economy of the future and beat China. \n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

We have to get a competition bill across the finish line—for Ohio workers, for our supply chains, and for our national security. We can’t rely on foreign competitors for the chips that power a 21st century economy. Read this letter from @SecRaimondo &amp; @SecDef: \n\nRight now, half of the materials that our women and men in uniform fight under can be made in China. This week, @SenatorCollins and I introduced the All-American Flag Act to ensure that the government buys flags that are made in America, by American workers.\n\n.@senrobportman and I agree: We need to get the Bipartisan Innovation Act across the finish line to help us better compete with China. It'll boost American manufacturing and make more investments in Ohio like Intel's possible. \n\nWhen we make more things in Ohio, we shorten supply chains and lower costs for Ohioans. That's exactly what this China competition bill does—time to get it to the President’s desk. \n\nWe know how to speed up our supply chains, lower prices, and end our reliance on China: Make more things in America. That’s the solution to so many of our economic problems. \n\nThere’s a simple way to keep this growth going, and to keep our economy competitive with China’s: Pass the Innovation and Competition Act. \n\nThe numbers out this morning are stunning. Thanks to the American Rescue Plan, for the first time in 20 years, our economy grew faster than China’s. \n\nSecretary Raimondo is right—the chips shortage is only going to get worse until we pass the China competition bill, which will boost Intel’s investment in semiconductor manufacturing in Ohio. \n\nInstead of relying on potentially-counterfeit KN95 masks from China, we should be supporting high-quality American products made by American workers. @SenatorBaldwin and I are urging @POTUS to replenish our national stockpile with Made-in-USA masks. \n\nThere's no reason we should rely on China for the majority of our critical pharmaceutical ingredients – We have the best scientists and manufacturers right here. My bipartisan bill with @SenBillCassidy will put a priority on domestic manufacturing. \n\nAs First Solar expands solar panel production, it’s adding hundreds of new jobs to Northwest Ohio. When we stand up for Ohio businesses against Chinese-govt-backed companies that cheat, we get more jobs in places like Wood County. \n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

This is just one more reason why Congress should prioritize protecting our institutions from the Chinese government. \n\nAs I said in a March HSGAC hearing, we know that billions of $$ in COVID-19 funding has been stolen by transnational criminal orgs in countries like #China &amp; Russia, many of whom used fraudulent schemes to exploit the pandemic for their own financial gain. \n\nThat’s why a trade agreement should include my bipartisan Leveling the Playing Field Act 2.0 to provide new tools to combat China's unfair trade practices to protect American jobs and support our industrial base.\n\nFirst, we need new negotiating authority to expand opportunities for American-made exports and constrain China. That requires passing the bipartisan Trading System Preservation Act to expand trade with allies and new bilateral agreements with the UK, Taiwan, Kenya, and Ecuador.\n\nEarlier this fall, in response to my questioning, TikTok’s COO refused to commit to cutting off all data &amp; metadata flows to China. Now a ByteDance Risk Assessment says it is not possible for the company to keep “sensitive and\/or regulated data” from China \n\nIn addition, I underscored the threats posed by our adversaries, such as Russia, Iran, &amp; China who rely on disinformation to weaken our democracy, &amp; the importance of separating the imminent threats of violence from censoring speech of American citizens. \n\nLike @FBIDirectorWray said earlier today, we are facing a “coordinated effort across the Chinese government to lie, cheat, and steal their way into unfairly dominating entire technology sectors.”\n\nThe 3 recent indictments from DOJ against numerous Chinese spies operating in the US, some of whom used academic covers to attempt to steal US fingerprint technology, is another reason why Congress must pass my Safeguarding American Innovation Act.\n\nAt a recent #HSGAC hearing, TikTok’s executive refused to commit to cutting off Americans’ data from China-based employees. American data should be safe from exploitation by the CCP. \n\nI am alarmed by recent reports that a #China-based team at TikTok’s parent company, ByteDance, planned to use TikTok data to monitor the location of American citizens. \n\nCelebrating Taiwanese freedom is more important than ever as China’s aggression against the sovereign territory continues to grow.\n\nToday on Taiwan National Day, I am proud to stand with Taiwan and congratulate them on their successful democracy and contributions to the international community.\n\nAt a July #HSGAC hearing, I stressed how critical it is to prohibit the purchase of drones made by our adversaries, like #China. I urge my colleagues to include the bipartisan American Security Drone Act in this year’s defense bill to do just that. \n\nI’m alarmed that the @FBI, @DHSgov, &amp; US law enforcement are continuing to purchase and use Chinese-made drones despite significant national security concerns about their use. \n\nWe must do everything possible to stop China and other foreign adversaries from stealing our taxpayer-funded research and innovation.\n\n#SAIA was the result of a year long bipartisan investigation that detailed specific instances of China’s talent recruitment program members likely stealing U.S. taxpayer-funded IP from natl labs to benefit China’s military &amp; econ over the last two decades \n\nThe report detailed how #China regularly uses its telecom carriers to further its intel collection &amp; espionage efforts.\n\nIn 2020, as then-Chair of #PSI, I released a bipartisan report detailing the potential national &amp; economic security threats posed by these Chinese-owned telecom carriers, and China Telecom Americas, operating in the US. \n\nI agree with @FCC’s decision to name Chinese telecom companies Pacific Networks Corp, ComNet USA LLC, and China Unicom Americas as threats to U.S. national security. \n\nGreat to visit with @Prez_Pinto today to discuss our impressive @uofcincy students and how the University is taking advantage of programs in the CHIPS Act as well as their education and workforce development efforts. \n\nIt’s concerning TikTok’s executive refused to commit to cutting off data from #China-based employees. All American data collected should be safe from exploitation by the CCP.\n\nAlarmingly, TikTok’s executive twice refused to commit to cutting off all data &amp; metadata flows to #China, Chinese-based TikTok employees, ByteDance employees, or any other party located in China. \n\nChina has a pattern of economic &amp; cyber espionage. At our #HSGAC hearing to examine social media’s impact on homeland security, I expressed my concern that since TikTok employees in #China have access to US user data, the CCP has legal authority to obtain that data. \n\nThe CHIPS Act was essential to bringing Intel to Ohio. It invests $52 billion to bring critical semiconductor manufacturing back to America and provides thousands of good-paying jobs to communities across the country, including #Ohio.\n\nThis is the largest economic development investment in state history. I have advocated for #Ohio as a prime location for semiconductor manufacturing and was proud to help spearhead Senate enactment of the CHIPS Act that helps make possible this investment and more in the future.\n\nI was a key negotiator in the Senate passed CHIPS Act, which invests $52 billion in semiconductor technology and provides thousands of good-paying jobs to communities across the country.\n\nToday’s groundbreaking ceremony would not have been possible without enactment of the CHIPS ACT, which will help revitalize semiconductor manufacturing in the US. I was proud to spearhead its passage in the Senate.\n\nIntel’s investment is already the largest in Ohio’s history and the company has indicated that with the CHIPS legislation, its record investment could grow even larger. I am looking forward to Intel’s groundbreaking ceremony in New Albany, #Ohio on Friday. \n\nI was proud to help lead efforts in the Senate to pass the CHIPS Act and ensure that Intel’s planned semiconductor plant in central #Ohio remained on track.\n\nCongratulations to @trussliz, the U.K.’s next prime minister. I look forward to working with you on a host of issues, including supporting our allies around the world that are under threat such as Ukraine, Taiwan, and Israel. \n\nOn this day 64 years ago the people of Taiwan fought bravely to defend their homeland. The U.S. must stand with Taiwan in the face of malign threats from China to change the status quo by force.\n\nGreat to see so many #Ohio leaders at the #CHIPS bill signing today.\n\nIntel’s announced investment is already the largest in #Ohio’s history and the company has indicated that with this CHIPS legislation its record investment will grow even larger over time.\n\nSemiconductor chips are essential to everything from automobiles, cell phones, household appliances, and military weaponry. The CHIPS Act will invest $52 billion in this technology and provide thousands of good-paying jobs to communities across the country.\n\nToday, I joined many friends at the WH signing ceremony of the bipartisan CHIPS Act, which will create thousands of good-paying #jobs in #Ohio, strengthen America’s economic competitiveness and boost our national security.\n\nThis request follows the report I released late last month that highlights how for more than 10yrs, #China has engaged in a sustained malign influence and info theft campaign against the @federalreserve and has taken advantage of our open &amp; collaborative research practices.\n\nToday, as the lead Republican on Senate #HSGAC, I joined my Republican colleagues on the Committee in sending a letter to @SenGaryPeters requesting a hearing on Chinese influence and information theft at the @Federalreserve. \n\nAs China continues to increase its aggression toward Taiwan, there are ways the U.S. can help as this editorial by @WSJopinion today explains. By jump-starting trade with Taiwan and throughout the Indo-Pacific, we can help Taiwan withstand China’s economic coercion.\n\nAlong with a majority of America’s competitors, China has no book minimum tax.\n\nThe Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that nearly 50% of this new “book tax” would fall on manufacturers—the effects of which could prove devastating. China currently has more than a quarter of the world’s manufacturing.\n\nGreat to join @JackieDeAngelis to discuss China’s latest threats and the Democrats’ reckless tax and spending spree, which will only make inflation worse. Check out my interview here  \n\nThe passage of the CHIPS Act last week is a huge win for #Ohio and for our national security. This is the first step to bringing semiconductor manufacturing back to the U.S. which will create thousands of high-paying jobs in #Ohio.\n\nEarlier this week, as the lead Republican of #HSGAC, I released a report that highlights how for more than 10yrs, China has engaged in a sustained effort to access the @federalreserve and has taken advantage of our open &amp; collaborative research practices.\n\nIt was great to join the Greater Akron Chamber of Commerce for breakfast this morning where we shared our excitement for the passage of the bipartisan CHIPS Act.\n\nGreat to be on with @Larry_Kudlow yesterday to talk about the report I released earlier this week which I hope will serve as a wake-up call to the @FederalReserve and other agencies of the Chinese govt’s malign efforts to target, influence, and undermine all of our sectors. \n\nToday’s House passage of the bipartisan CHIPS Act means we are one step closer to bringing more semiconductor manufacturing back to the U.S. and Intel’s investment in #Ohio is closer to reality. This bill also protects our national security and I urge @POTUS to sign it quickly.\n\nThis bill will ensure @intel’s semiconductor plant in central #Ohio remains on track and reaches its full potential. @intel's investment is the largest in Ohio’s history and the company indicated the CHIPS legislation its record investment will grow even larger over time.\n\nToday’s passage of the CHIPS Act is critical in the effort to bring semiconductor manufacturing back to the U.S., protect our national security, and create thousands of high-paying jobs in #Ohio. I was proud to help lead efforts in the Senate to pass this legislation.\n\n#China is targeting the U.S. @federalreserve. Glad I could discuss my report on their efforts to undermine &amp; influence the Fed with @DavidWestin on @BloombergTV. \n\nThe risk is clear, I urge the @federalreserve to do more, working with @FBI, to counter this threat from one of our foremost foreign adversaries, #China.\n\nI am concerned by the threat to the Fed and hope our investigation, which is based on the Fed’s own documents and corresponds with assessments and recs made by the @FBI, wakes the Fed up to the broad threat from #China to our monetary policy.\n\nBased on a Federal Reserve counterintelligence analysis &amp; unheeded FBI recs to change the Fed’s policies &amp; procedures, this report finds the Fed has been the target of an extended &amp; effective Chinese malign influence &amp; info theft campaign.\n\nThis investigation makes clear that China’s malign efforts at influence and information theft are not limited to science and technology fields — American economic &amp; monetary policy is also being targeted by the Chinese government. \n\nThis morning, as the lead Republican on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, I released a report that I’ve been working on since 2020 as then Chairman of #PSI that details China’s malign efforts to target, influence, &amp; undermine the US @federalreserve.\n\nWe cannot continue to stand by as #China steals our US taxpayer-funded research &amp; IP to fuel its military &amp; economic rise. That’s why my bipartisan Safeguarding American Innovation Act must be included in the final CHIPS Package to protect the $250B investment in research &amp; IP.\n\nIt is concerning that a competitiveness bill on the floor now invests millions in US taxpayer $ in research and does not include any strong provisions to safeguard that research from being stolen by foreign adversaries like China.\n\nLast night I took to the @SenateFloor to correct the record on how my Safeguarding American Innovation Act was stripped from the CHIPs package currently under consideration.\n\nThat’s why the House must pass the Senate-passed #USICA legislation, which includes the American Security Drone Act and would prohibit US federal agencies from purchasing Chinese-made drones.\n\nI was troubled to hear at a #HSGAC hearing govt officials confirm that our federal govt is purchasing Chinese-made Unmanned Aircraft Systems, otherwise known as drones, which pose a potential national security threat of having info relayed back to #China &amp; used against us.\n\nThis morning I spoke with the @DaytonChamber about keeping America competitive through the CHIPS Act, and my bipartisan JOBS Act that helps keep #Ohio’s workforce strong and resilient. \n\nLet’s get #USICA passed to ensure we no longer purchase these drones from #China &amp; protect our national security. \n\nDuring a #HSGAC hearing yesterday, admin officials confirmed that the fed govt is buying Chinese-made drones, posing a severe national security threat. \n\nThe Biden administration should start working with Congress on a bipartisan basis on multilateral tax cooperation and tariff issues related to China.\n\nWe should work with our trade partners on economic agreements that support American workers, not bully them into supporting the administration’s agenda while giving China and Russia a pass.\n\nThe administration ignored my request to withdraw from our tax treaty with Russia over its invasion of Ukraine but is considering lifting tariffs on China.\n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

If Biden wants clean energy, then let's empower our domestic producers here at home.\n\nBiden’s rush to green overlooked what was needed of the U.S. supply chain to successfully implement his climate agenda. In doing this, he has directly emboldened one of our nation’s greatest adversaries: China. Read this week's column here: \n\nAnother great argument for my American Made Pharmaceuticals Act. There's no reason we should continue our reliance on China for pharmaceuticals when we can support American manufacturing and boost supply here at home. \n\nJohn Kerry’s claims to put the natural gas industry on “notice” are outrageous.

The America Concedes Act is nothing but $325 BILLION worth of reckless spending that will surrender our competitive edge to China. If we want to fix the supply chain and inflation crises, we need to put America first.\n\nThe Biden Admin is so scared of the optics of tapping into American oil, they’re begging China to do it instead.

Speaker Pelosi's decision to make this partisan reflects Democrats' skewed priorities: partisan messaging over policymaking. \n\nThe economic and national security threats from China grow every day, and the Chinese Communist Party has been clear that their target is to surpass the United States. We cannot afford to play politics while the China threatens the United States. \n\nYesterday, FBI Director Wray stated, \"there's just no country that presents a broader threat to our ideas, innovation, and economic security than China\".

No matter what the final vehicle is for funding the CHIPS Act, I look forward to working with my colleagues to get it done as soon as possible. FULL STATEMENT: \n\nChina has made it clear they want to dominate the globe in key technology areas, including the semiconductor market. U.S. technology companies obtain as much as 90% of their semiconductor chips from Taiwan, a huge risk given the geopolitical situation in the region.\n\nIf we want to stay ahead of the curve and outcompete adversaries like China, we must redouble our commitment to R&amp;D.

We are also committed now, more than ever, to all elements of the Taiwan Relations Act.\n\nWhile I will always support increasing American competitiveness, this bill boosting funding for the American semiconductor manufacturing sector all but ignores our top priority when it comes to competition with China: our military. \n\nWith the Chinese Navy steadily growing to 460 ships by 2030, we must stop the unforced errors in Navy shipbuilding. The #FY23NDAA will push the Navy to leverage best practices so we can grow our fleet to compete with China. \n\nChina. Russia. Iran. North Korea. Terrorists. Inflation. A recruitment crisis. We are facing the most serious set of national security challenges I’ve seen in my lifetime. Congress can respond by passing the #FY23NDAA. I urge @SenSchumer to bring this bill to the floor ASAP.\n\nWith all the threats we face, especially from China and Russia, Congress must make sure our military has the resources and equipment needed to deter our enemies and, if necessary, to fight and win. That's what this year's National Defense Authorization Act does. #FY23NDAA \n\nWe need to keep pace with our greatest threat, China, while responding to the severe challenges posed by Vladimir Putin’s Russia in Europe. This year’s NDAA paves the way to do just that. \n\nThe Chinese Communist Party appears to be continuing its unprecedented military expansion. As we consider this year’s #NDAA and our military posture in the region, including through the Pacific Deterrence Initiative, protecting a free and open Indo-Pacific must be a priority. \n\nI’ve written a letter w\/ @senrobportman urging President Biden to retain U.S. tariffs on billions of dollars’ worth of China-made products. These tariffs target China's illegal and unfair trade practices and must be kept. More below: \n\nFrom the get-go, I’ve been alarmed by China’s tacit support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. It becomes clearer every day that the interests of the Chinese Communist Party are diametrically opposed to those of America. We must prepare for a long competition. \n\nPromising results from Air Force’s recent hypersonic missile test. However, until we consistently provide @DeptofDefense with the real budget growth it needs, China’s and Russia’s lead in hypersonic strike capabilities will only grow larger. #FY23NDAA \n\nWith the Chinese Navy steadily climbing to 460 ships by 2030, the unforced errors in Navy shipbuilding, like the Littoral Combat Ship, must stop. Programs that can scale up and grow our fleet must be the priority. \n\n\"It takes us three years to do what China can do in three days,\" our other witness said. That's eroding our comparative advantage. \n\nThe dramatic growth in the number of Chinese Navy warships has been fueled by international sales of commercial ships built in the same shipyards. This must stop - buy from Allies! \n\n.@WSJ has it right: “The bill for decades of complacency and neglect is coming due at a dangerous moment, as China ramps up its fleet.” Congress must act and give our military the resources it needs! \n\nPleased to see DOD &amp; NNSA continuing long-overdue investments to rebuild our aging nuclear forces, but I'm still concerned that the administration remains unwilling to reclaim the ground we’ve already lost to China &amp; Russia. Expect #FY2023NDAA to put us back on a more secure path \n\nI led Congress in creating the Pacific Deterrence Initiative to help improve our military posture in that region. As long as we resource it properly, it could be a game changer in long-term competition against China as well.\n\nWith increasingly capable Chinese and Russian submarines on patrol more often, the effect of canceling the fatally flawed LCS ASW package is at least an 11-year gap in ASW frigates. Another unacceptable Navy acquisition debacle. \n\nThe @USNavy says we need at least 355 battle force ships to counter future threats from China &amp; Russia. @POTUS’s budget takes a step backward – decommissioning 24 while building just 8 new ones. This puts us on track to a SMALLER Navy fleet over the next 5 years. Illogical. \n\nSince Putin’s indiscriminate killing of women and children and bombing of hospitals and schools isn’t enough for President Xi to close the door on Russia, @POTUS must make it clear: If China provides Russia with military aid, there will be a price to pay.\n\nWhy would China give more weapons to Putin, who has shown his willingness to use those weapons to bomb hospitals and apartment buildings in Ukraine? \n\nAcross the globe, our adversaries, like Communist China, are taking notes on how the United States and our allies and partners are responding to the crises in Ukraine and Afghanistan. \n\nAgree with @US_STRATCOM ADM Richard's statements at today’s hearing. We are in a new era. The time has come to look at what additional nuclear capabilities we need before China and Russia leave us behind. \n\nFar from making the U.S. and its allies safer, hollowing out our nuclear forces only invites further Russian, Chinese aggression. The upcoming Nuclear Posture Review needs to focus on rebuilding a deterrent capable of meeting the growing threats we face. \n\nIf true, seems like @SecDef recognizes historic inflation is destroying @DeptofDefense’s buying power and is trying to address it. But – this isn’t the 3-5% growth over inflation our military needs per the ‘18 NDS. It’s just treading water. That won’t cut it vs China &amp; Russia. \n\nThe Biden administration's approach to the Indo-Pacific leaves a lot to be desired. I remain very concerned that their actions will not match their rhetoric when it comes to being tough on China. My full statement on the new Indo-Pacific Strategy ↓ \n\nChina &amp; Russia are using Africa to expand their influence &amp; military reach &amp; the terrorist threat in Africa is expanding. Yet we've never given @USAfricaCommand the resources it needs. I'm glad to receive a commitment from a key @DeptofDefense nominee to make this a priority. \n\nRussia. China. North Korea. We face growing threats around the world — we can’t let our military slide backwards after years of gains. Adequate, full-year national security funding must be Congress’ top priority. \n\nOne of the most important things this year’s NDAA does is direct much-needed resources to the Indo-Pacific and reorients the Pacific Deterrence Initiative toward making real improvements to U.S. force posture in the Indo-Pacific to deter Chinese aggression. \n\nWhy, in the face of growing Chinese &amp; Russian aggression, is the administration even considering nuclear policy changes? If true, yet again the Biden administration is putting its focus in the wrong place. Our nuclear deterrent is our best defense – it needs to stay that way. \n\nA vote to discharge this resolution is a vote to give Iran and China and Russia more power and influence in the region, and will make our world less safe. \n\nI've been warning about this for months. If China were to have a military base on Africa's west coast, it would give China an enduring naval presence in the Atlantic and a larger platform to threaten the U.S. and project power globally. We should not let this happen. \n\nThe #FY22NDAA would boost quantum computing — a critical emerging technology. We must make sure the U.S. stays ahead of China — even as China pours resources into technologies like this. Just another reason this bill is so important. \n\nThe U.S. is one of seven nations, including China &amp; North Korea, that allows for abortion on demand beyond the point babies feel pain. Roe v. Wade is inhumane and must be overturned in order to give power back to state and federal lawmakers to modernize the law and protect life.\n\nWe need to stand strong against China and Russia. That's why @SenSchumer's Senate #FY22NDAA process is a failure. He's more concerned about protecting the Biden administration instead of American families. My full statement on today's floor vote ↓ \n\nThe Biden administration is yet again tone deaf on nuclear policy. China is building hundreds of new ICBMs at a breakneck pace, and Russia’s arsenal already surpasses ours. We must modernize our nuclear forces to deter these growing threats. \n\nWe’re continuing to see technology that’s more &amp; more advanced from China. As @SecDef put it, China is our “pacing threat” &amp; we are failing to keep up. If we want to catch up, we need to speed up investment and reduce bureaucracy at the @DeptofDefense. \n\nI was honored to meet with His Highness Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed, the Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi, and others during my visit in June about our mutual concern regarding Chinese military activities in the Middle East. I pledged during that visit to work closely with the UAE … \n\nOur military’s #2 says China’s recent missile test looks like a “first-use weapon” – meaning they’re designing it so they can strike us 1st. Talk of changing US nuclear policies flies in the face of facts. If @POTUS changes our policies, it makes us &amp; our allies more vulnerable \n\nI’m not the only one who’s very concerned about what China is doing with hypersonic weapons. My colleagues in Congress agree that we have to invest in our military to maintain a favorable balance of power – and deter China from a position of strength. \n\nI’ve talked repeatedly about China building replicas of our ships &amp; aircraft for target practice. Now, we have a picture of a mock US aircraft carrier w\/escorts on rails so the PLA can practice hitting it while moving. We need to do more &amp; move faster to be ready for this threat. \n\nMeanwhile, in the three months since the Armed Services Committee passed this bill, the threats we face around the world — China and Russia, North Korea and Iran, terrorist organizations in Afghanistan — have only gotten worse.\n\nAs China &amp; Russia rapidly modernize &amp; expand their militaries, @DeptofDefense has instead focused on @POTUS's progressive social agenda. I led my @SASCGOP colleagues in asking Gen. Milley for more info so we can understand how this misplaced focus affects military readiness. \n\nChina’s relentless expansion of its nuclear arsenal continues unchecked. A new @DeptofDefense report says China is likely to have &gt;1,000 nukes by 2030. Yet @POTUS remains unconcerned – just like with Afghanistan, he’s dangerously disconnected! More  \n\nTune in at 11 AM ET as I join my Senate colleagues pushing for a Senate vote on this year’s National Defense Authorization Act. With all the threats we face from China, Russia, terrorists, Iran, North Korea, national security must be Congress’ top priority. #FY22NDAA \n\n.@POTUS can’t ignore our allies and partners: A “No First Use” or “Sole Purpose” nuclear policy would be a “huge gift to China and Russia,” - fracturing our alliances, undermining our credibility and inviting aggression. \n\nThe Pentagon’s #2, General Hyten, is warning us what will happen in @DeptofDefense keeps moving too slowly: China will win. Their hypersonic weapons are just the tip of the iceberg. The Pentagon must move faster. \n\nBiden has decided to leave the U.S. in the middle of an ever-worsening border crisis and a massive supply-chain crisis for a climate conference that won’t even be attended in person by some of the world’s worst polluters: China and Russia.\n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

China must be held accountable for putting Americans at risk and I look forward to working with my colleagues to do just that.\n\nChina lied. Americans died. Days away from taking the majority, @HouseGOP has already done what Democrats refused to do for 2 years: Investigate China.\n\nBetter uses of $80 billion than an IRS auditing army: - finishing the border wall - taking drug manufacturing back from China - fixing Medicare - putting baby formula back on shelves - expanding tele medicine - supporting veterans - broadband infrastructure\n\nApple was quick to criticize states like Georgia for their (secure) voter laws but was even quicker to cut Airdrop (a critical tool for pro-democracy activists) from iPhones in China when Xi asked them to. Another blaring example of corporate hypocrisy!\n\nWe are at an inflection point in our country. Corporations have decided to betray national interest for the sake of cheap labor. Commitment to their bottom line and shareholders should never trump human rights. They should immediately condemn the CCP. #ChinaProtests\n\nThe Chinese people are tired of the tyrannical CCP, and are pushing back against their draconian Covid measures. Why are companies like Apple, who rely heavily on cheap Chinese labor, silent on the protests?\n\nIf you have @tiktok_us on your phone delete it immediately. It has all of the indications of a data tool used by the Chinese Communist Party.\n\n🚨Tune In!🚨 I’m joining @seanspicer and @NEWSMAX at 5pm to talk TikTok and how the Chinese Communist Party is using this app to target our children. Don’t miss it! \n\nRather than hold China accountable for their sins against this nation, Biden exchanged pleasantries with the CCP this week. Meanwhile, I demanded answers from FBI Director Wray on behalf of worried parents. China is using TikTok to target our children and must be stopped. \n\nIn the secure America we all deserve, there’s no place for a criminal who has profited off of his father’s Oval Office connections to adversarial nations like China. It’s high time Hunter Biden answered for his crimes.\n\nChina doesn’t need to drop a bomb to hurt America, they just need to cut off our API’s and medications. USAntibiotics, in my home district, is leading the mission to bring drug manufacturing back to where it belongs, on American soil.

Not only is our enemy now well supplied, they have firsthand knowledge that we are NOT.\n\nThe WHO is no longer reliable, I won’t support our involvement. It’s time for America to withdraw from the China-parroting organization. I joined @RepTiffany to demand that the Biden Admin take action to put an end to the WHO’s influence on our nation. \n\nThe World Health Organization has become China’s puppet. They MUST be STOPPED\n\nI don’t trust any organization that takes talking points from the Chinese Communist Party. #DefundWHO\n\nThe World Health Organization is no longer the information sharing hub that it was intended to be. The WHO continues to parrot the Chinese Communist Party and NOT A SINGLE CENT of American tax dollars should be used to help them as they put the world in harms way.\n\n“The threat is simple; we are consuming medication acquired from our enemy. This isn’t surprising-China has never been our friend-but it is frightening” Read my @FoxNews OpEd here. \n\nI’m thrilled to see a fierce champion of Democracy, @KeithJKrach, nominated to receive the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize. His tireless pursuit of peace, advocacy for Taiwan, and re-envisioning of peaceful international relations makes Keith a truly worthy candidate. Congratulations! \n\nA pinky promise from the Chinese Communist Party is not enough when lives are at stake. \n\nThe American people haven’t forgotten China’s dishonesty about the spread of COVID, their theft of American intellectual property, and their hostility toward sovereign Taiwan.\n\nIt’s a bad day for Democracy when China leaves the negotiating table with a smile. Despite the recent coziness President Biden has shown our adversaries, China is not our friend.\n\nEach year, China steals BILLIONS in our intellectual property. Our financial loss is the CCP’s militaristic gain. It’s time for the Biden Administration to stop playing nice with our enemies and get a grip on our national security.\n\nBiden’s Commerce Secretary just completely dismissed the threat of the Chinese Communist Party. What world is this administration living in?\n\nI’m disappointed that Nicaragua broke off diplomatic ties with Taiwan. The United States should stand with our friends in Taiwan against the aggression of the CCP. \n\nYesterday I visited with the Hancock County Farm Bureau to discuss agriculture, healthcare and the national security threats posed by the Chinese Communist Party. Thanks for the visit! \n\nI joined my fellow @China_TaskForce members in calling for the Biden Administration to start addressing the national security threats presented by the Chinese Communist Party. It’s time for sleepy Joe Biden to wake up! \n\nToday I joined @jacksonhlthcare, @GovBillLee and local officials for the ribbon cutting at USAntibiotics. This plant is the last manufacturing facility in the country authorized to produce Amoxil and Augmentin and is critical for decreasing our reliance on China for medicines. \n\nIt’s clear that the Chinese Communist Party is hiding vital information on the origin of COVID-19, with another report raising questions about a leak from the Wuhan lab. We need a full investigation now &amp; must hold the CCP accountable for their cover up. \n\nThe Countering Communist China Act is the strongest effort to combat the malign influence of the CCP, our greatest national security threat, introduced this Congress.

I fully support its decision to drastically increase defense spending over the next few years, and I applaud everyone involved in making the decision. \n\nI joined @ShaunKraisman on @Newsmax to talk about the massive fentanyl crisis. China is mass producing it, smugglers are trafficking it over our southern border, and Americans are dying because of it. \n\nI joined @CarleyShimkus on @FoxFriendsFirst to talk about President Biden's call with Chinese President Xi Jinping. The United States needs to stand strong against the Chinese Communist Party and crack down on its aggression toward our allies in Taiwan. \n\nDon't miss my latest episode of Tennessee Talks! On this episode, Ambassador @bikhim and I talk about the CCP's aggression toward Taiwan, how it parallels Russia's war with Ukraine, and other issues facing our Taiwanese allies. \n\nI was proud to cosponsor the House version of this bill that was just signed into law. Our Taiwanese allies deserve to be properly recognized by the @WHO for their major success in dealing with the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\nI joined @MikeEmanuelFox on @foxnewsnight to discuss the Biden Administration's disastrous foreign policy. The #ChineseCommunistParty has its eyes on Taiwan and you can bet its next move depends on how the United States handles Vladimir Putin and the war he started in Ukraine. \n\nVladimir Putin's violence against Ukraine must be met with extreme punishments from the United States and NATO. Taiwan's sovereignty from the Chinese Communist Party could depend on how we respond.\n\nThe United States needs strong policies that crack down on China's government, not the weak bill House Democrats brought to the floor last week. Check out my latest op-ed about an appropriate response to the CCP by our government. \n\nThe CCP hopes the Olympic Games will distract the world from heinous acts like this as well as aggression towards Taiwan and theft of American intellectual property. As Americans watch the Winter Olympics, they must remember Communist China's hostilities.\n\nA Uyghur skier carried the Olympic torch to open the games, then immediately disappeared from the spotlight. Tennis star Peng Shuai is attending the Olympic Games, reemerging from a mysterious disappearance after accusing a #ChineseCommunistParty official of sexual assault.\n\nI tried to introduce an amendment to today's bogus China competition bill that would protect Americans' intellectual property from being stolen by the #ChineseCommunistParty. Democrats rejected it. We can never hope to compete with the CCP if we keep letting them steal our ideas. \n\nThe America COMPETES Act is a missed opportunity for us to counter the #ChineseCommunistParty. This bill does practically nothing to bolster the American economy or crack down on Communist China. \n\nI and other House Republicans tried to amend the Democrats’ do-nothing bill in an effort to actually accomplish something to counter China’s anti-competitive practices, but the Dems said “NO WAY!” \n\nSpending billions of dollars on woke climate and social justice initiatives has absolutely nothing to do with the United States' ability to compete with the #ChineseCommunistParty.\n\nDemocrats' COMPETES Act is not about keeping up with the #ChineseCommunistParty. The CCP is mentioned only nine times throughout this bill's nearly 3,000 pages, while the @WhiteHouse fails to mention the CCP once in its Statement of Administration Policy for this legislation\n\nSpreading democracy matters to the Biden administration just as long as its not in a country the #ChineseCommunistParty wants to invade. \n\nThe #ChineseCommunistParty knows there are no consequences for its human rights violations, including the use of Uyghur slave labor. That needs to change, and it starts with the Biden administration countering the CCP's wrongdoing with action, not finger wagging and empty words. \n\nThe Taliban chased us out of Afghanistan, the Chinese Communist Party is threatening Taiwan, and now Putin is on the verge of invading Ukraine. President Biden's soft foreign policy enables our adversaries to push the United States and our allies around without consequence. \n\nPolysilicon, a crucial material in solar panel production, is heavily mined using Uyghur slave labor at the direction of the #ChineseCommunistParty. Joe Biden should think twice about how solar panels are made before lecturing Americans on the greatness of solar energy. \n\nToday, I introduced the American Genetic Privacy Act, legislation that would prohibit DNA testing companies from violating Americans' trust by selling their genetic information to malicious foreign actors affiliated with the #ChineseCommunistParty. \n\nThe #ChineseCommunistParty is trying to bully Lithuania because their government dared to establish a relationship with Taiwan. It's clear the CCP will intimidate and harass anyone who refutes their flawed claim to the island. \n\nThe #ChineseCommunistParty spent months covering up the COVID-19 outbreak instead of warning the world. Our government needs to hold the CCP accountable and eliminating funding the Wuhan Institute of Virology with American taxpayer dollars is a good place to start. \n\nThe Biden administration needs to quit being weak with foreign adversaries. Enough finger-wagging. If we want to prevent cyberattacks by Russia and the #ChineseCommunistParty, cyber counterattacks and economic sanctions need to be on the table. \n\nThe #ChineseCommunistParty is building its nuclear and missile arsenal while refusing to engage in arms negotiations with the United States. This violates the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and one of my EAGLE Act amendments directs @SecBlinken to hold the CCP accountable. \n\nIt's time Congress officially recognizes the United States is in a Cold War with the #ChineseCommunistParty. We need to stop playing patty-cake with the CCP and I'm glad my amendment to the EAGLE Act on this issue passed with bipartisan support in the @HouseForeignGOP Committee. \n\nThe @NBA bows to the #ChineseCommunistParty, muzzling its own players and fans to keep President Xi happy. I introduced an amendment during the @HouseForeignGOP mark-up on the EAGLE Act to prevent the State Department from conducting commercial diplomacy on the NBA's behalf. \n\nToday marks 100 years of existence for the #ChineseCommunistParty. Here are just some of the CCP’s many lowlights. \n\nDuring a 19-hour hearing, @TransportDems showed more interest in funding woke causes and the #ChineseCommunistParty than our own infrastructure. We need to focus on funding roads, bridges and waterways instead of partisan agendas. \n\nI introduced the TRIPP Act today with @RepRichHudson to protect American medical innovations from intellectual property theft. We cannot allow adversaries like the #ChineseCommunistParty to steal our medical breakthroughs and use them to their advantage. \n\nI spoke with @SecBlinken about the #ChineseCommunistParty working to build a more \"trustworthy, lovable and respectable\" image. The Biden Administration shouldn't fall for it. The CCP isn't changing its dictatorial and genocidal policies, and we can't trust a word they say. \n\nIt's ridiculous the @WHO elected Belarus and Syria to the executive board despite their human rights violations, but allowed the #ChineseCommunistParty to block Taiwan from gaining observer status. They're clearly playing politics with global health. \n\n50% of all polysilicon used in solar panels is produced in the Xinjiang Province by Uyghurs enslaved in #ChineseCommunistParty internment camps. \n\nThe #ChineseCommunistParty already doesn’t honor climate agreements and they aren’t about to start. During today’s @HouseForeignGOP hearing, I cautioned Climate Czar Kerry against trusting the CCP like he did the Iranians with the 2015 nuclear deal. \n\nWe need to get to the bottom of John Kerry's dealings with the untrustworthy #ChineseCommunistParty. \n\nIt's pathetic John Kerry is excusing the #ChineseCommunistParty’s enslavement and murder of the Uyghurs to make a slimy climate arrangement. We shouldn't get involved in a disastrous climate plan the CCP won’t follow and that will weaken any economic leverage we have with China. \n\n.@ToddPiro asked me on @FoxFriendsFirst this morning if our costly efforts on climate change matter if China isn't going to do anything. My response: heck no. Our country should not negotiate with the #ChineseCommunistParty on environmental issues. \n\nTaiwan has been one of the most successful nations in the fight against COVID19. They need to be allowed to share their knowledge and practices at the upcoming World Health Assembly #LetTaiwanHelp \n\nImprisoning these brave activists for ‘unlawful assembly’ exposes the sheer injustice &amp; totalitarianism that runs rampant in the Chinese Communist Party. They aren't even trying to hide it anymore. The CCP needs to realize the world won’t stand for these morally bankrupt actions. \n\nThe Chinese Communist Party's intimidation of Taiwan through military chest thumping and diplomatic pressure is unacceptable. The Biden administration must stand with our Taiwanese friends and oppose the CCP's mission to suppress democracy and freedom in Taiwan. \n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

I'm proud to vote yes on this legislation that strengthens our military readiness, provides service members a 4.6% pay increase, counters the threat from China, &amp; ends the vaccine mandate in our armed forces.\n\nICYMI: I joined @BobSellersTV and @KatrinaSzish on @newsmax to discuss how we must stand up for America by addressing aggressions from China &amp; finding solutions to the rampant #Bidenflation that is hurting families across our nation. Watch my interview here  \n\nI met with former NBA player @EnesFreedom, an outspoken fighter for civil rights in countries like China and Turkey. The U.S. cannot allow the CCP to continue committing human rights abuses. I appreciate Mr. Freedom’s leadership, and for working to hold China accountable. \n\nThis week, @SpeakerPelosi brought to the floor the America COMPETES Act. This bill would help China &amp; hurt our national interests. I also co-sponsored the Protect &amp; Serve Act. This bill would create federal penalties for those who deliberately target law enforcement w\/ violence. \n\nThe Chinese Communist Party has proven to be a severe threat to our country’s safety and security. Instead of holding the CCP accountable, @SpeakerPelosi and House Democrats’ COMPETES Act concedes to China and fails to protect American interests. \n\nAs @FBI Director Wray said, the counter-intelligence threat posed by China is more damaging than ever to our nation. Every 12 hours on average, the FBI opens a new Chinese-related case. We must work to protect our interests rather than concede to China. \n\nInstead, @amnesty should focus on real human rights abusers like China, Iran, and North Korea. I promise to always stand firm with our greatest and strongest ally, the State of Israel.\n\nWe must increase pressure on Iran to stop its dangerous nuclear advancements. I joined @RepMcCaul in sending a letter to @SecBlinken urging @JoeBiden to end current Iran talks. Instead, we must enforce existing sanctions, particularly between Iran &amp; China.\n\nI spoke on the House floor about how the Dems’ reckless spending plan will leave severe &amp; lasting consequences on our nation’s economy. We must end this out-of-control spending &amp; instead address real-world problems such as fixing our supply chain &amp; the serious threat from China. \n\nThe Dems’ massive reconciliation bill includes a Made in America Tax. This would make the U.S. less competitive around the world &amp; push companies to move production &amp; jobs to China. Instead of giving foreign companies a leg up, we need to increase job opportunities for Americans.\n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

We must stand firmly against China’s increasing aggression.\n\nCommunist China sent over 70 warplanes to intimidate Taiwan on Monday. The U.S. must always support the freedom-loving people of Taiwan.\n\nI will not stop fighting to bring manufacturing back to America and end our reliance on Communist China.  \n\nTikTok cannot be allowed to operate in the United States. The Chinese-based company tracked and surveilled American journalists, including @ebakerwhite, @SchwabKatharine, and @richardjnieva. \n\n@WhiteHouse @PressSec The Biden administration must make it crystal clear to Communist China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia that the United States is serious about our security and continued freedom – not woke mandates.\n\nTikTok allows Communist China to steal your personal data. Thank you, @GovBillLee, for your work to ban access to TikTok on government networks in the Volunteer State.\n\nPresident Biden should be laser focused on ensuring the military can defend the USA from Russia, China and Iran. Instead, he’s fixated on forcing the military to get vaccinated for COVID. Read my op-ed in @nypost  \n\nJimmy Lai has fearlessly dared to hold Communist China’s feet to the fire – no matter the personal cost. His conviction is proof the CCP has taken over Hong Kong. May we carry the torch of freedom that Jimmy and so many others have sacrificed for, until communism is no more.\n\nCommunist China uses TikTok to spy on Americans and influence the information they consume. So why is the Biden administration negotiating with TikTok in the first place?\n\nWe must end our dependence on Communist China. Producing our own products ensures that our supply chains are not disrupted by other nations and creates American jobs.\n\nProtestors in China are reporting that footage of protests is being deleted remotely on Huawei phones. These actions are alarming and unheard of. The CCP’s grip is tightening, and we must take the threat they present seriously.\n\nFreedom fighters in China are standing up to the Chinese Communist Party and their consistent violation of human rights. That is something to commend.\n\nWe should all stand with protestors of the Chinese Communist Party. \n\nCould the climate change deal be the reason the Biden White House is remaining silent on the China protests?\n\nJoe Biden should take to the podium, offer his support to protestors of the Chinese Communist Party, and unequivocally condemn Xi Jinping’s regime. There’s nothing to walk around here. \n\nXi Jinping and his authoritarian regime will not get away with their crimes against humanity. It is my hope that these protests in China shed light on this abusive regime.\n\nPresident Biden must stand up against Xi and urge him not to use violence against the peaceful protests. Chinese citizens are making their voices heard and are speaking out against communism. The United States must support these freedom fighters.\n\nProtesters in China are standing up to an evil, abusive, and tyrannical regime. I stand with them every step of the way.\n\nThe CCP is responsible for harmful actions against the Chinese people. The Chinese people should stand up against the regime and protect themselves.\n\nThe CCP is an evil regime. The ongoing protests in Communist China show that the Chinese people are pleading for change.\n\nNew emails continue to show Fauci downplayed the possibility that COVID came from a lab leak in China. It is time to tell the American people the truth.\n\nCommunist China's failed zero-COVID policy has resulted in record infections, destroyed livelihoods, and created a mental health crisis. Why does China continue to enforce these lockdowns when they aren’t working?\n\nThis meeting is an opportunity for President Biden to decisively communicate where our nation stands – with Taiwan and our freedom-loving partners around the globe and against the egregious human rights abuses of the Chinese Communist regime.\n\nPresident Biden has an opportunity to stand up to Xi Jinping on Monday, and he must demonstrate that the U.S. will not back down to the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nWhy did Joe Biden invite users of Chinese-backed TikTok to speak on Ukraine’s war at the White House? Why did they prop up a service that poses national security threats to us, @WhiteHouse? \n\nTikTok is telling European users that staff in Communist China can access their data. The CCP is treating TikTok’s users and their data as its own.\n\nEconomic data from Communist China is mysteriously becoming harder to find as growth slows. Are we surprised? This is what the CCP does — they disappear unflattering reports or people that could get in their way.\n\nIt is not surprising that TikTok’s parent company allegedly planned to track the location of American users. The company is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. We must pass a national privacy law. \n\nThe Chinese diplomat responsible for assaulting a pro-Hong Kong protester this last week proclaimed it was his ‘duty.’ These are the values that Communist China instills, and we cannot afford to stay silent about it.\n\nPresident Xi has taken suvellience to a whole new level since the COVID pandemic. This is why we never want Communist China to win the race in developing core technologies.\n\nChina is recruiting 30 former British military pilots, demonstrating that they will do anything to steal intel for global dominance.\n\nXi’s goal is total dominance – whether it be through his stifling zero-COVID policy, his grip on the technology industry, the targeting of Muslim Uyghurs, escalating threats against Taiwan, or an authoritarian grip on global governance.\n\nRecent footage in Manchester shows a man being dragged into the Chinese consulate after protesting outside, then being beaten by the consulate staff. Let me be clear: these actions will not be taken lightly. We must stand with those protesting the CCP’s crimes against humanity.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party claims it has a ‘right’ to use force against Taiwan. Taiwan has no interest in reunification — this is a threat — and it’s why we must never back down to this rogue, authoritarian regime.\n\nLast week, the UN voted to refuse debate about China’s abuses against the Uyghurs. What ever happened to respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, @UN? \n\nMay our friends in Taiwan have a wonderful 111th National Day! I hope you enjoy celebrating your freedom, democracy, and sovereignty. \n\nThe Chinese Communist Party has set up a police station in NYC to reportedly help track their citizens abroad.\n\nStrong engagement between the U.S. and Solomon Islands is critical to deterring security challenges in the region. During my visit in August, I spoke candidly with leaders across the spectrum about the dangers of Communist China's influence.\n\nOver 160 Los Alamos National Laboratory scientists have reportedly been recruited by the CCP and returned to Communist China for its hypersonic, missile, and submarine programs. This scientific espionage poses a serious threat to our national security.\n\nCommunist China does not give a rippin’ flip about what pronouns their soldiers are using. They are preparing for global domination. We must stop our military from going woke. \n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

These lethal drugs are being pipelined into our country–mostly through our wide-open southern border. \n\nFentanyl–mass produced by multi-billion dollar Mexican cartels with the help of the Chinese Communist Party–is killing a generation of Americans. What volume of American overdose deaths will be enough for @POTUS to finally &amp; swiftly secure our southern border? \n\nMy colleagues in @SenateGOP &amp; I are certain that we can increase opportunity &amp; prosperity for American families by ending our reliance upon the Chinese Communist Party &amp; reasserting our manufacturing independence to strengthen our national security. \n\nWhile China’s threats to the Free &amp; Open Indo-Pacific are growing, Japanese PM Kishida’s government is taking bold &amp; necessary steps to meet challenges in the 21st century &amp; advance the US-Japan Alliance. My &amp; @SenatorCardin’s statement on Japan’s new National Security Strategy: \n\nAdmin naively believes Biden-Xi meeting created new ballast for relations, yet China keeps competing aggressively—even as top U.S. officials visit Beijing. Admin must resist temptation to sit on competitive actions. China is our greatest strategic rival. \n\nIn a new provocation, China just sent a significant number of PLA aircraft, incl. a record 18 nuclear-capable bombers, into the SW part of Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ). \n\nThe Twitter files confirm that its former executives were working with Biden campaign officials to censor the information Americans were allowed to see, including news about Hunter Biden’s corrupt China dealings. (1\/3)\n\nHagerty: ‘Apple is removing the main tool that they use to transfer information only in China. A tool that the Chinese Communist Party is using to shut down communication.’ \n\nThe White House has ceded control of our southern border to these billion-dollar cartels that work in partnership with the Chinese Communist Party to ship fentanyl into America. They are killing our kids. We must stop this. \n\nThe CCP doesn't represent the Chinese people—we're seeing that on television right now. The CCP represent their own interests, &amp; they have been amazingly aggressive. We're going to have to deal with it much more forcefully than the White House has been willing to do thus far. \n\nThe CCP's “Zero COVID” lockdowns are oppressive &amp; tyrannical as well as inhumane and unscientific. @Apple's effort to trample Free Speech &amp; collude with the CCP to shut down communication and silence the voice of the Chinese people is despicable. \n\nChina is growing its nuclear arsenal to rival America faster than many believed possible. A world w\/ two nuclear-armed peers—Russia &amp; China—will pose profound challenges to the U.S. &amp; our allies. We must do everything to counter this growing danger.\n\nWill @POTUS @JoeBiden condemn how @Apple's software updates to iPhones in China are hobbling the ability of Chinese protestors to communicate? \n\nGetting ready to join @cherylcasone on @FoxBusiness to discuss the latest on protests in China and more. Tune in! \n\nThe Chinese Communist Party’s surveillance operations are an incredible violation of the sovereignty of every nation where these stations are located. The Biden Administration &amp; the DOJ must stop allowing this type of activity to occur and push back against the CCP. \n\nThe recent surge of protests across China remind us: the CCP is not the same as the Chinese people. The CCP denies basic freedoms to the Chinese people and oppresses them daily. Xi Jinping's \"Zero COVID\" policy is merely an egregious example of the CCP's totalitarian rule.\n\nChina has become so bold that they are running intelligence surveillance operations within the U.S. The Biden Administration &amp; the DOJ need to step up and push back against the CCP. I discussed with @johnrobertsFox on @AmericaRpts. WATCH: \n\nThis week I joined @SenRubioPress in sending a letter to U.S. Sec. of Defense Lloyd Austin warning that DOD reported plans to retire its fleet of F-15 fighter jets in Japan, w\/o replacing them with a permanent presence undermines efforts to deter a potential attack on Taiwan. \n\nThe question remains: While Joe Biden was conducting U.S. foreign policy in China &amp; other places as VP, what did he know about his son’s deals with influential leaders in those same countries to generate many millions of dollars to benefit the Biden family?\n\nWhile AG Garland foolishly shut down DOJ’s China Initiative in February to avoid “harmful perception” of targeting China—despite CCP’s unparalleled espionage threat—it turns out CCP was spying on DOJ itself. Hopefully this is a wake-up call. \n\nMake no mistake: What CCP General Secretary Xi Jinping did yesterday to his predecessor, Hu Jintao, is what Communist China wants to do to the United States by no later than 2049. \n\nThe Chinese Communist Party micro-manages public appearances, so this is a public humiliation of former leader Hu Jintao. Xi Jinping is sending a big message as he begins unprecedented 3rd term as CCP General Secretary. \n\nChinese technology company Huawei’s Pengxinwei IC Manufacturing Company semiconductor plant is designed to fatally undermine US strategy to counter the CCP. I joined @SenTomCotton in calling on the Biden Admin to take immediate action to halt Huawei’s attempt to build the plant. \n\nSending our best wishes to everyone celebrating Taiwan National Day. Deeply thankful for Taiwan’s friendship and look forward to our continued strategic partnership!\n\nFor too long, U.S. law has allowed many people in the U.S. who are paid to actively promote the interests of Communist China. Pleased to join @JohnCornyn and other colleagues in legislation to prevent foreign adversaries from influencing U.S. policy.\n\nWords matter—particularly overseas. Yet, Biden once again makes a promise that his Administration has to walk back. We must send a strong, consistent message against Communist China, not the mixed messages coming from the White House.\n\nAfter massive accounting scandals by China-based companies, the U.S. Congress &amp; President Trump sought to address these risks by enacting the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act. It’s critical that the Biden Administration fully and faithfully implements this law.\n\nU.S. capital markets are the envy of the world and afford substantial competitive advantage for those who access our markets. Yet companies based in China have been allowed to play by a different set of rules.\n\nGreat start to another day on my Economic Development Tour this morning at @CHAchamber’s Federal Focus Event with @RepChuck. We discussed several important topics, from our economy in Tennessee to the threat Communist China poses to our nation. \n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

As a member of @CECCgov I will continue to stand up call out oppression &amp; religious persecution around the world.\n\nWe must stand with Tibet! Today is the 63rd anniversary of the Tibetan Uprising. On March 10, 1959, tens of thousands of Tibetans took to the streets of Lhasa, Tibet’s capital, rising up against China’s illegal invasion and occupation of their homeland. \n\nThe Chinese Communist Party is brutally and systemically trying to destroy the Uyghur people.

Today, the President signed the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act into law. As Chair of the Uyghur Caucus as a Commissioner on the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, I helped lead this legislation.

All perpetrated by the Chinese Communist Party. \n\nThe House must pass the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. Put simply, we’re talking about crimes against humanity by the Chinese Communist Party against the Uyghurs.

I am happy to join Central New York in celebrating our local Taiwanese American community. \n\nThe CHIPS and Science Act has the potential to draw once-in-a-generation investments to CNY while securing our nation’s supply chain for critical semiconductor tech. I was glad to be in attendance this week as this crucial legislation was signed into law. \n\nThe CHIPS Plus Act will make historic investments in domestic manufacturing and has the potential to be transformative for CNY. I was proud to join with local leaders, CNY businesses, and @SenSchumer to celebrate its passage and tout its tremendous benefits here in our community. \n\nICYMI: I joined @SeanDuffyWI on @FoxBusiness to discuss my strong support for the CHIPS Plus Act and how this legislation allows us to be more competitive with China. Watch below. \n\n(4\/5) Notably, I am deeply disheartened that Congressional Democrats have decided to immediately turn around from the success of the CHIPS Plus Act &amp; take up a separate, partisan reconciliation bill that raises taxes.\n\n(1\/5) Today’s vote on the CHIPS Plus Act represents a historic leap forward for investment in American innovation and national security, &amp; I was proud to help pass this bill in a bipartisan manner &amp; send it to the President’s desk.\n\nMy message today is simple: let’s pass the CHIPS Act and invest in domestic semiconductor manufacturing. This vital legislation would be transformational for Central New York and our country. This is not the time to play politics. \n\n(3\/3) Provisions I put forward in the CHIPS Plus Act encourages companies to come to the United States, while this new reconciliation bill tries to push them back overseas. Listen to my discussion on @DaveAllenShow about these vital issues below. \n\n(2\/3) While I'm optimistic that CHIPS will receive bipartisan support in the House, it's beyond disheartening that Washington Dems have decided to pursue separate, partisan legislation that will raise taxes &amp; put an additional strain on our economy as we’re entering a recession.\n\n(1\/3) I am excited to cast my vote in favor of the CHIPS Plus Act. This legislation has the potential to secure our domestic supply chain for critical semiconductor technology and transform Central New York’s economy.\n\nThe Senate has just passed the CHIPS Plus Act, and I urge my colleagues in the House to join me in supporting this critical bill. Watch my remarks below on why this is one of the most significant pieces of legislation lawmakers will vote on this Congress. \n\nI cannot overstate the transformative potential that the CHIPS Plus bill could have for Central New York. I look forward to working with my colleagues to get this legislation across the finish line as soon as possible. \n\nThe CHIPS Act offers a generational opportunity for investment in CNY’s economy and our nation’s domestic supply chain for critical semiconductor technology. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in supporting this legislation. \n\nICYMI: I joined @SIAAmerica and @rollcall to discuss my enthusiastic support for the CHIPS Act. The U.S. semiconductor industry sorely needs this investment and I am excited to see this long overdue measure signed into law. \n\nICYMI: I penned an op-ed published by @thehill regarding China’s leveraging of the 2022 Beijing Olympics to obscure its flagrant human rights violations, anti-democratic actions, and military and economic aggressions. \n\nChina is a threat to American security and has a dismal record on human rights. A diplomatic boycott of the Olympics in Beijing falls short of the action needed to hold China accountable. \n\nI joined @ABCGMA3 to discuss the rise of violent crime across the country and why I believe a boycott of the 2022 Beijing Olympics is necessary amid China’s growing military aggressions and human rights abuses. Watch below. \n\nICYMI: I penned an op-ed published by @FoxNews regarding China’s exploitation of US academic institutions to make technological and military advances. \n\nOur nation is vulnerable when we rely on China for critical goods. We must take steps to bring manufacturing back to the US and work on bolstering our domestic supply chain. \n\nIt’s clear our nation has become over reliant on China, and it’s having an impact on our local manufacturing sector. (2\/3) \n\nI joined the bipartisan @ProbSolveCaucus to urge Congress to fully fund the CHIPS for America Act. Doing so could jumpstart semiconductor manufacturing in Central New York by delivering investments to build new domestic manufacturing facilities. \n\nThe semiconductor shortage is stunting economic growth, hurting workers, and providing foreign competitors with opportunities to further disrupt our supply chain. That’s why I'm pushing for Congress to fully fund the CHIPS for America Act. \n\nWith the @ProbSolveCaucus , I called on Congress to fully fund the CHIPS for America Act. Funding this bill would help secure the U.S. supply chain and has the potential to jumpstart semiconductor manufacturing in CNY and nationwide. \n\nI was featured on Fox &amp; Friends highlighting the national security implications of our supply chain crisis. Instead of being reliant on adversaries like China for critical goods, the Biden Administration needs to take proactive steps to strengthen American manufacturing. \n\nI joined @AmericaRpts to discuss my push for the U.S. to boycott the Beijing Olympics &amp; my efforts to combat the growing threat posed by China. The U.S. must stand strong against China’s ongoing human rights abuses and risks to our national security. \n\nFor years, the Chinese government has become increasingly bold in their efforts to weaponize their private sector for intelligence and military purposes, exploit the data of Americans, and manipulate global markets. What’s more, they have continued to actively engage in genocide.\n\nI led the @HomelandGOP in calling on the new administration to develop a plan for protecting our country against the growing threat posed by China. \n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

This is critical to national and consumer security. The bill also presents potential opportunities for WNY. \n\nI joined @RepPeteStauber in cosponsoring the Accessing America's Critical Minerals Act. As foreign adversaries like China continue to try and dominate advanced manufacturing, we must secure America's domestic supply chains for critical minerals. \n\nI joined @RepJimBanks in writing a letter to Disney expressing our deep concerns with their work in communist China and creation of woke content to indoctrinate our kids. \n\nWe must hold China accountable. \n\nThe weakness of the Biden admin has emboldened our enemies. We cannot tolerate attempts by nations like Russia, China and Iran to undermine the United States. We need to restore strength to our nation, regain our energy independence, and increase American competitiveness.\n\nThis is disgraceful. @EnesFreedom had the courage to speak out about the egregious human rights abuses of the Chinese Communist Party and was fired. The NBA pretends to be “woke” but they continue to stay silent on the CCP’s abuses to protect their profits. Shameful.\n\nI cosponsored the China Task Force Act, a comprehensive bipartisan package that got tough on China &amp; set our nation up for success. Instead of pursuing that goal, Dems are forcing through the CONCEDES Act that is as soft on China as they are on crime. More unserious legislating \n\nI joined @WBEN to discuss the impacts of the President’s vaccine mandates. At a time when our economy is struggling and Chinese aggression is accelerating, the President should not be forcing Americans out of our workforce and defense contracting. \n\nFurther evidence that the threat of China must be taken seriously. We must maintain our investments in our military and continue to pursue innovative new technologies. \n\nChina is watching the stunning weakness being shown by President Biden and his admin. The fallout of the devastation in Afghanistan will only weaken our standing on the world stage, dishearten our allies, and embolden our enemies to test our resolve. \n\nThe more we learn, the more it becomes absolutely necessary for a thorough and independent investigation into the origins of COVID-19. China must be held accountable for their lies and manipulation. \n\nYesterday, on the 100th anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party, I joined my colleagues in support of a resolution condemning the CCP for a century of human rights violations. The CCP must be held accountable for these atrocities. My full statement: \n\nI joined my NY colleagues to call on colleges in our state to cut their ties with Confucius Institutes. The Chinese Communist Party uses these to distribute propaganda and infiltrate American higher education. These are a threat to our students and must come to an end. \n\nI signed this letter because it is far past time for thorough and transparent investigations into the origins of COVID-19. Millions of Americans have suffered at the hands of this virus. They deserve answers and the Chinese Communist Party should be held accountable. \n\nChina’s resistance to a transparent investigation into the origins of COVID-19 is revealing. We need an independent and thorough investigation to answer the growing questions about the start of this pandemic. \n\n“China wields new strength from years of military buildup. It has become more aggressive with Taiwan and more assertive in sovereignty disputes in the South China Sea. Beijing also has become more confrontational with Washington” China is a global threat.\n\nOver a year later, we still do not have a full answer to the origins of COVID-19 because the Chinese Communist Party continues to lie, manipulate, and cover-up critical information. We need an independent investigation to hold the CCP accountable. \n\nChina is a proven threat on the international stage with numerous human rights violations and malign trade practices - we must maintain a strong approach toward China and the CCP. \n\nI joined my colleagues in calling for the Secretary of the USDA to hold China accountable for purchasing agreements made under the Phase One trade deal. Enforcing this agreement is critical to American farmers. More info: \n\nI re-introduced the No Small Business Aid for China Act. American small business aid should only support American businesses. China is a proven national and economic security threat and I will continue to confront their malign activities. My statement: \n\nToday I spoke in favor of the waiver allowing General Austin to serve as Secretary of Defense. The national security threats facing our nation – like China and Iran – require the leadership of an experienced and Senate-confirmed Secretary. My full remarks: \n\nI have spoken out against the Chinese Communist Party’s treatment of the Uyghur people and their atrocious human rights record. We must do more to confront the CCP for human rights abuses, and for the continued threat they pose to US and Global security.\n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

I stand behind my colleagues @Jim_Jordan &amp; @RepAndyBiggsAZ in their pursuit for answers on the DOJ’s dismissal of charges against 6 #CCP spies. \n\nThis crisis begins in China where the precursor chemicals are manufactured and then used in Mexico to produce large amounts of fentanyl. The Biden Administration can combat fentanyl trafficking by securing the southern border, but current policies have hurt not helped. \n\nMeet Dr. David Toy, a veteran World War II Army technician. I recently had the opportunity to present Dr. Toy with a certificate of recognition for being honored with the Chinese American Congressional Gold Medal and to thank him for his remarkable service to this country. \n\nGiven China’s practice of acquiring critical US assets, antitrust regulators must be able to follow the money on mergers when SOEs are involved.

It’s time we take off the kids gloves and start backing up our words with real action. Proud to be a cosponsor of this @RepublicanStudy bill, led by @RepJimBanks. \n\nI joined @RepGallagher’s resolution to condemn the Chinese Communist Party for 100 years of gross violations of human rights.

Now Biden wants to restrict travel from India and there’s hardly a peep out of the media. Liberal hypocrisy knows no bounds! \n\nChina remains a key source of supply for precursor chemicals Mexican cartels use to produce large amounts of fentanyl they are smuggling into the U.S. I joined @Newsmax to talk about how the influx at our southern border is exasperating both the border &amp; drug crisis in the U.S. \n\nI offered an amendment to H.R. 1333 at a @JudiciaryGOP markup today.

It's past time for us to crack down on the CCP's human rights abuses, slavery, &amp; genocide. \n\nThere is nothing *normal* about the behavior of Communist China, and America cannot afford to enable it on a *permanent* basis any longer. I introduced bipartisan legislation to revoke China’s preferential trade status with @RepTomSuozzi and Chris Smith. \n\nCommunist #China treats America as a dumping ground for criminal aliens. I've introduced a bill to stop it once and for all. \n\nCommunist China is again violating its hollow promises to resolve its differences with #Taiwan peacefully. It is time to end the dishonest \"One China Policy\" and normalize US-Taiwan ties. \n\nGlad to see @SpeakerPelosi took my advice, told #CommunistChina and President Biden to pound sand, and will proceed with her trip to #Taiwan. I’ll be talking about that and more on @SiriusXMPatriot shortly.

C'mon man! \n\nAmerica's failed \"One China Policy\" is stuck in a 1970s time warp. It is enriching the Chinese Communist Party, hurting our economy, and undermining our national security. It's time for a change. \n\nJoe Biden 🤝 Communist China \n\nThe WHO is a corrupt, wholly-owned subsidiary of Communist China. Giving this bureaucracy even more power after the incompetence of the last 2 years is like hiring the arsonist who started the fire to help you put it out. We must withdraw from #WHO! \n\nA great read from my good friend @RepPeteStauber. Instead of crippling our domestic mining industry and increasing our reliance on foreign countries, like China, for critical minerals, we need to support Made-in-America mining here at home. \n\nThis week, I asked President Biden to visit #Taiwan and meet with President Tsai @iingwen during his trip to Asia. I sincerely hope he will consider doing so. America doesn't need a permission slip from #China to talk to our friends and partners. \n\nIt's no secret that @SpeakerPelosi and I don't agree on much, but I'm glad she is paying an official visit to #Taiwan -- and ignoring the predictable temper tantrum from the Chinese Communist Party. \n\nThe #CCP has taken advantage of their preferential trade status for over two decades. It’s past time for Congress to right the wrongs made by previous lawmakers and revoke China’s Most Favored Nation trade status. If not, America’s manufacturing sector will continue to suffer. \n\nAmerica's trade policy with Communist #China has been a total disaster for 20 years. It has made America weaker, and China's oppressors stronger. That's why I introduced bipartisan legislation with Rep. Chris Smith &amp; @RepTomSuozzi to end it. \n\nFor too long, presidents of both parties have embraced a failed and unfair trade policy that has shipped our jobs to China and enriched the brutal dictatorship in Beijing. It's time for a change. \n\nOver the last two decades, we’ve seen America’s manufacturing sector suffer while China’s rulers engage in slavery &amp; genocide. We can't afford to enable this bad behavior on a ‘permanent’ basis anymore. China's preferential trade status must be revoked! \n\nMore and more Americans are seeing the outdated and dishonest \"One #China Policy\" for what it is: A failure. It's time for Congress to recognize reality by passing my bill to recognize #Taiwan. \n\nHappy Lunar New Year of the Tiger to the Taiwanese-American community leaders and friends in Wisconsin!\n\nThe genocide ambassador from Communist #China has gone too far. Threatening Americans on American soil is outrageous. @POTUS should tell Comrade Qin to pack his bags and expel him from the United States immediately. \n\nPelosi’s COMPETES Act is weak. It is time to hold Communist China accountable. \n\nWhen @VP Harris was Senator Harris she backed high-level meetings between senior US and #Taiwan officials. Yesterday I asked her to do as VP what she voted for in the Senate, and meet directly with Taiwan’s Vice President William Lai next week.  \n\nLooks like a Golden State @Warriors owner said the quiet part out loud about the @NBA view on the #genocide being carried out in #China. Hey Coach @stevekerr -- care to give your boss an assist here? \n\nCommunist China's genocide, forced labor camps, widespread human rights abuses, espionage and threatening to destroy #Taiwan apparently didn't make the cut. \n\nThe illegitimate, corrupt and undemocratic Ortega regime's decision to become a client state of #China by cutting ties with #Taiwan will only make life worse for the people of #Nicaragua. The Biden admin should lead by example and recognize Taiwan. \n\nAmerica's Carter-era \"One China Policy\" is dishonest and outdated. It's time for America to lead by example, and recognize Taiwan as a free and independent nation. We don't need a permission slip from China to have normal ties with our friends and allies. \n\nTwitter banned a former US president and censors investigative journalism like #projectveritas – but gives state-run Chinese “media” outlets blue checks. If Twitter is going to host #CCP propaganda agents, could they at least replace their blue checks with red ones?\n\nFor 50 years, Taiwan has been unfairly excluded from the United Nations. This must change. Fact: Taiwan is an independent, democratic country. Fact: Taiwan has never been part of Communist China, even for one day. Fact: China is China, Taiwan is Taiwan. \n\nBiden’s disastrous withdrawal leaves the door open for the Taliban and China to take advantage of Afghanistan's mineral wealth. We must do all that we can to produce these key minerals here at home and reduce dependency on adversaries like China.  \n\nEffective diplomacy has to be more than just words. The Biden admin must take concrete steps in response to Communist China's dangerous and reckless provocations in the #Taiwan Strait. \n\nMy friend @RepScottPerry and I sent this letter to #Biden admin today demanding full membership in the #UnitedNations for #Taiwan. America doesn't need a permission slip from Communist #China to support our allies. It's time: #UNforTaiwan \n\nPublic health officials' dizzying record of flip-flops on everything from mask mandates to the origins of COVID-19 in a Chinese lab, has permanently damaged the credibility of our public health agencies.\n\nGreat to meet with Taiwan Ambassador @bikhim &amp; @MOFA_Taiwan Our countries share a deep commitment to democracy &amp; human rights. America doesn’t need a permission slip from #China to talk to our friends #TaiwanCanHelp #TaiwanIsaCountry \n\nOn this day 32 years ago, we remember the thousands of pro-democracy protesters killed by Chinese troops in the Tiananmen Square massacre. Never give up. \n\nOver the last year, Congress has spent over $7 trillion, but Dems still want to continue to spend even more. I joined @RepublicanStudy to introduce their most conservative budget yet - which includes two of my bills: the ACRE Act and the bill to scrap the One China Policy.\n\nSending a thank you to @FAPA_HQ for helping to coordinate a donation of 50,000 face masks from the Taiwanese people to medical providers in WI-07. #TaiwanIsHelping and could help even more if @WHO would stop excluding Taiwan to appease China.\n\nIt’s time to break China’s dangerous choke-hold on the W.H.O. Taiwan’s exclusion from the W.H.O. due to Chinese pressure isn’t just unfair, it is unwise – and as we saw last year, it is unhealthy. It’s time to #LetTaiwanHelp. \n\nI, along with @RepScottPerry, re-introduced the bill to do away with the \"One China Policy\". For over 40 years, American presidents of both political parties have repeated Beijing’s bogus lie that Taiwan is part of Communist China – despite the objective reality that it is not.\n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

But what we can do is build an anti-navy designed to target the PLA and deny their ability to act on Taiwan. Here's Rep.

That gives you your best chance of actually preventing a war from happening in the first place. We're not doing that with Taiwan.\" \n\nIn light of these threats, Rep. Gallagher and @SenTomCotton introduced a bill that would place YMTC and Chinese companies like it on the SDN list. Read more here: \n\nYMTC is a CCP-backed company and their push to provide Apple with flash memory chips is part of the CCP's effort to both cripple the U.S. chip market, increase our dependence on China, and undermine our national security. \n\nRep. Gallagher's statement on President Biden's recent '60 Minutes' interview, where he committed the U.S. to defending Taiwan against a CCP invasion for the fourth time. \n\nRep. Gallagher on efforts to advance the Taiwan Policy Act: \"The failure of deterrence in Ukraine shows that we cannot wait until the shooting has started to provide critical weapons to Taiwan. We must act with a sense of urgency before it is too late.\" \n\n\"We have a window here where we can push to give our friends in Taiwan the resources they need to defend themselves... The lesson of Ukraine is we need to arm our friends before the invasion begins, before the shooting begins. That's our best chance of avoiding war.\" \n\nRep. Gallagher’s statement in response to Taiwan's announcement of a record 13.9% increase in its defense spending. \n\nRep.

Gallagher on the Biden administration's attempts to dissuade Speaker Pelosi from going to Taiwan: \"Who the hell is the Executive Branch to tell the Legislative Branch where we can travel?\" \n\nThe Taiwan Travel Act explicitly makes it US policy for officials at all levels to travel to Taiwan. We cannot allow the CCP to have a veto on when CODELs can visit Taiwan. @SpeakerPelosi should not back down and press ahead with her trip. \n\nThe price of gas is skyrocketing, but instead of unleashing US energy production, President Biden is making it easier to buy Chinese solar panels. Read Rep. Gallagher and @RepPeteStauber's op-ed outlining how absurd this policy is. \n\nRep. Gallagher's statement on President Biden declaring the U.S. would intervene military if the CCP launched an invasion of Taiwan. \"The President must follow it up with the decisive action that will be required to deter a CCP invasion of Taiwan within the next five years.\" \n\nRep. Gallagher: \"If we're going to talk about integrated deterrence, what we should integrate is the State Department moving heaven and earth to negotiate basing agreements with key allies so we can deploy teams of marines and soldiers in order to deny a PLA invasion of Taiwan.\" \n\nRep. Gallagher on the need to revitalize the defense industrial base: \"We've blown through 7 years worth of Javelin missiles and 25% of our Stinger stockpile. These are systems we are going to need going forward, particularly if we are going to try and help Taiwan defend itself.\" \n\n\"Time is running out to solve one of the most important national security problems of the decade.\" Watch Rep. Gallagher join @FDD for an event to outline steps the US needs to take to deter CCP aggression and stand with Taiwan. \n\nRep. Gallagher: \"Our energy policy is totally incoherent and is actually benefiting both Putin and Xi. There is no way we can compete effectively with the Russians or the Chinese if we pursue this war on domestic energy production.\" \n\nRep. Gallagher Putin and Xi's relationship: \"This isn't a silent partnership...Putin is becoming Xi's sadistic sidekick in this New Cold War that they have launched against the West. He will only grow more dependent on China the more he experiences setbacks in Ukraine.\" \n\nRep. Gallagher: \"If we do not invest in hard power in the Indo-Pacific, the Chinese are going to launch an invasion of Taiwan, and that is going to be a disaster for the free world.\" \n\nBiden officials are taking victory laps on the strategy of integrated deterrence despite the fact it failed in Ukraine. In @WSJopinion, Rep. Gallagher argues preventing a similar failure with Taiwan requires DoD to reverse course &amp; reinvest in hard power. \n\nRep. Gallagher to @JerryDunleavy: \"We need to wake up to that reality and make the consequences for any concrete Chinese intervention in Ukraine clear.” Read more here: \n\nThe Biden administration failed to deter Putin's war in Ukraine and the CCP is taking notes. Rep. Gallagher and @SenDanSullivan outline lessons we should learn from these mistakes to ensure deterrence doesn't fail again in Taiwan. \n\nRep.

Gallagher: \"If China decides to intervene on behalf of Putin by providing military assistance, we should be prepared to punish China for doing that.\" \n\nRep. Gallagher introduced the Protecting our Pharmaceutical Supply Chain from China Act, which would end U.S. dependence on China for pharmaceutical manufacturing. Read more about his bill from @mikeginsberg98 here: \n\nRep. Gallagher: \"We need to call out the role that the Chinese are playing here. This alliance among authoritarian states is a feature of the New Cold War that China has launched against America. The sooner we recognize that, the sooner we can win the New Cold War.\" \n\nRep. Gallagher joined the @HooverInst's #GoodFellows podcast with @nfergus, @LTGHRMcMaster, and @JohnHCochrane to discuss Putin's war in Ukraine, the Biden admin's deterrence failures, and what it means for Taiwan. Listen to the full conversation here: \n\nCIA Director Burns tells Rep. Gallagher that the U.S. should not minimize Russia's claims that Russia, Iran, and China swindled the U.S. in negotiations over a new Iran deal, and that there is \"genuine concern\" over how Russia will try to utilize leverage from the deal. \n\n“The Chinese support all of Putin’s narrative to blame the West for provoking Russia,” Rep. Mike Gallagher said. “I see no change in the Chinese views on Russia. They remain in a de facto alliance against the West at this point.” \n\nRep. Gallagher: \"I fear that the weakness we've projected has expedited Xi Jinping's timeline for Taiwan. He might feel like he should make a move in the next 2 years because he can get away with it. We need to do a better job of communicating why this is so important to the US.\" \n\nRep. Gallagher: “Another day, another statement in Farsi deriding Americans as racist, xenophobic, Islamophobic, and more. Is it the Mullahs? Chinese or Russian propaganda? No, it’s the Vice President of the United States…” \n\nUnless things change, America is on track to lose World War III, either through a failure to compete or through defeat on the battlefield. In a new @FDD report, Rep. Gallagher outlines how we can reverse this trend and deter a CCP invasion of Taiwan. \n\nRep. Gallagher joined @RepBryanSteil and more than 100 other Republicans in calling on President Biden to take immediate action on fentanyl pouring in from China and across the southern border. Read more here: \n\nRep. Gallagher: \"We haven't heard a coherent plan from the military for how are we actually going to defend Taiwan. We've asked for access to the war plans, but we can't get them. How are we supposed to make decisions about what weapon systems to fund if we don't have a plan?\" \n\nRep. Gallagher's statement after voting against the COMPETES Act, a nearly 3,000 page bill that is riddled with loopholes and provisions that make the U.S. less competitive with China. Read more here: \n\nRep. Gallagher joined @GOPLeader, @RepMcCaul, @RepMikeRogersAL, and members of the @China_TaskForce in calling on the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee to keep US athletes safe and properly inform them of the CCP's human rights abuses.

I commend the admin and our service members for successfully carrying out this operation...this is an important reminder that as we start to focus on China, we can't take our eye off the ball in the Middle East.\" \n\n\"Armed with a sense of urgency, the United States can defend Taiwan and, in the process, defend the free world.\" Rep. Gallagher lays out a plan to deter and, if necessary, win a war over Taiwan in his most recent @ForeignAffairs article. Read more below:\n\nAs he writes, “For the United States, acting swiftly to build Battle Force 2025 will not be easy. The Pentagon is inclined to inertia...But armed with a sense of urgency, the United States can defend Taiwan and, in the process, defend the free world.”\n\nAnd third, prepare Taiwan for a long fight by ending strategic ambiguity, providing Taiwan with additional resources for its defense, improving training of Taiwanese forces, and building new joint operational planning structures for the defense of Taiwan.\n\nSecond, harness the hardware we have by making use of ships slated for retirement, upgrading our conventional missile arsenal, prioritize buying and modifying weapons that improve our ability to see or strike Chinese forces, and strengthening munitions supply chains.\n\nTaiwan, and our interests in the Indo-Pacific, don’t have time to wait for the Navy to build Battleforce 2045. We need a Battleforce 2025. And in a new Foreign Affairs op-ed, Rep. Gallagher lays out a way we can achieve it. \n\nRep. Gallagher on the price of Biden's weakness: \"It's not just Ukraine. Xi Jinping is sitting there thinking given how weak America looks, he could get away with an invasion of Taiwan. If the worst he's going to suffer is a mean hashtag from Jen Psaki, he's going to go for it.\" \n\nThis week, Chamath, a 2% owner of the Warriors, said \"no one cares\" about the ongoing genocide in China. Rep. Gallagher, who is also a co-owner of a major sports franchise, responds: \"Tech bros, keep apologizing for genocide because it really clarifies whose side you're on.\" \n\nFollowing reports that China has locked down a third city due to COVID-19 concerns ahead of the Olympics, Rep. Gallagher called for the U.S. and other countries to demand complete transparency from the Chinese Communist Party regarding COVID-19 cases in China. \n\nRep. Gallagher's statement after Intel apologized to the Chinese Communist Party for telling its suppliers not to use products made from slave labor in Xinjiang. \n\nRep. Gallagher: \"Not only do we need to invest in the U.S. to bring back the production of key technologies to ween ourselves off of our dependency on China, but we also have to stop sending capital to China to finance our own destruction.\" \n\nRep. Gallagher: \"You have this wing of climate change evangelists in the Democratic Party that don't want to get tough on China because they believe we can come to a grand bargain with the CCP on climate change...it's naive, destructive, and undermining our military deterrent.\" \n\nRep. Gallagher: \"We need to put some steel in the spine of U.S. foreign policy. Otherwise, we won't just be talking about Afghanistan or Ukraine. Sooner rather than later, we could be talking about the loss of Taiwan. And that really means the loss of U.S. global leadership.\" \n\nRep. Gallagher's statement after voting to support the FY2022 NDAA, which keeps faith with our men and women in uniform, delivers critical wins for Wisconsin, and helps counter China. Read more here: \n\nRep. Gallagher on the need for the U.S. to better communicate the risks associated with a confrontation with the CCP over Taiwan: \"In such a confrontation, Las Vegas rules would not apply. What happens in the Taiwan Straits would not be confined there.\" \n\nRep. Gallagher spoke with @SeanDuffyWI about President Biden's energy crisis: \"This energy strategy is a geopolitical gift to our enemies like China. It's as if Xi Jinping himself designed a strategy to undermine domestic production in America &amp; undermine US energy independence.\" \n\nRep. Gallagher: \"The State Department is encouraging our diplomats not to use the phrase \"malign Chinese influence\"...the Defense Department seems to be walking away from the term great power competition...this all amounts to a more naive approach to China. That concerns me.\" \n\nRep. Gallagher on President Biden's virtual summit with General Secretary Xi Jinping: \"The whole thing was absolutely absurd...It was as if President Biden got into a time machine and tried to go back to 2010 and the Obama administration's failed cooperative approach with China.\" \n\nRep. Gallagher on the FEC's decision to allow foreign money to influence U.S. ballot initiatives: \"This is shortsighted and dangerous. If you open this little crack, I can guarantee you that the Chinese Communist Party is going to take advantage of it.\" \n\nThis morning, Rep. Gallagher spoke with members of the Greater Madison Chamber about his bill, the Endless Frontier Act, and the important investments it will make to help ensure states like Wisconsin can help the U.S. out-innovate and out-compete China. \n\nStep 5: Create more Kennans and cultivate next generation of China experts and cyber experts right here in Wisconsin \n\nStep 3: Defund communist genocide by prohibiting American universities from partnering with Chinese researchers and technology companies that, by nature of China’s military-civil fusion, fund crimes against Uyghurs. \n\nICYMI: Last week, Rep. Gallagher joined the Wisconsin State Senate Committee on Universities and Technical Colleges, where he laid out five steps our state and the UW system can take to protect America from Chinese Communist Party (CCP) influence. Those steps are outlined below. \n\nRep. Gallagher joined @RepMcCaul and members of the @China_TaskForce in calling on Secretary Raimondo to take actions that help ensure US-derived tech doesn't support the CCP's malign activities.

Gallagher outlined ways higher education institutions can protect themselves from threats posed by the Chinese Communist Party. The @CollegeFix has more on the proposals he outlined here: \n\nRep. Gallagher joined @FoxFriendsFirst to discuss reports that China conducted a hypersonic missile test: \"This should be our wake-up call, but instead we are asleep at the wheel.\" \n\nHAPPENING NOW: Rep. Gallagher is testifying before the Wisconsin State Senate Committee on Universities and Technical Colleges about protecting higher education institutions from threats posed by the Chinese Communist Party. Tune in on @WisconsinEye here: \n\nRep. Gallagher on China's hypersonic missile test: \"This should be a wake up call not just to the defense community, but to the American people about the type of threat we're dealing with. We're dealing with a regime that will stop at nothing to undermine US leadership &amp; power.\" \n\nRep. Gallagher’s statement following reports that China conducted a hypersonic missile test. \n\nRep. Gallagher: \"The CCP wants to annex Taiwan...they're stonewalling this inquiry into the origin of a pandemic that's upended all of our lives.

I led the @probSolveCaucus in calling to increase our production. We must pass the CHIPS Act. \n\nWe as the U.S. have addressed human rights issues as a priority while China clearly has not. Nevertheless, we cannot spend ourselves into oblivion with expensive entitlements for all who ask if we are going to remain a superpower both economically and militarily.\n\nTUNE IN: I will be live with @TeamCavuto on @FoxBusiness at 12:30 PM to discuss U.S.-China tensions.\n\nSome Americans ‘mistrust’ Biden admin after Afghanistan, China ‘mismanagement’: Rep.

This week I joined my colleagues to send a letter to Disney asking for answers about their decision to censor content. \n\nAmid the Chinese Communist Party's continued aggression towards the people of Hong Kong and Taiwan, this decision is deeply troubling. \n\nThe recent military exercises by the #ChineseCommunistParty near #Taiwan are unacceptable. The American people will always stand against the Chinese Communist Party's oppression of the free people of Taiwan. \n\nThe #ChineseCommunistParty has no claim to absolute sovereignty over #Taiwan. The Taiwanese people have a right to freedom and self-government, the United States must always stand with them. \n\nThe United States must stand against the Chinese Communist Party's aggression and with the free people of #Taiwan. \n\nThe Chinese Communist Party is using slave labor to mine rare earth elements. American taxpayer dollars should never go to supporting this horrible practice. \n\nThe illicit fentanyl that is made in China and then crosses the porous southern border winds up on our streets in Pennsylvania, spurring addiction, tearing apart families, and – worst of all – killing our friends and neighbors. We must end the Biden Border Crisis. \n\nThe Chinese Communist Party’s crackdown on pro-democracy protestors is deeply disturbing. America must always stand with the free people of Hong Kong. \n\nToday I joined @GOPDoctors, Whip @SteveScalise, and @RepStefanik to call for an investigation into the origin of the COVID-19 virus. We must demand transparency from the Chinese Communist Party and seek justice. \n\nThe Chinese Communist Party must be held accountable for intentionally covering up the COVID-19 virus outbreak. I urge Speaker Pelosi to join Republicans in exposing this regime’s blame in the pandemic and demanding answers from the Chinese Communist Party. \n\nAs they start asking questions about the origin of the COVID-19 virus, the Democrats finally are waking up to the growing threat of the Chinese Communist Party. Now more than ever, we must ensure that this hostile regime can never again unleash a pandemic onto the world.\n\nFor too long, the WHO has served as a willing pawn of the Chinese Communist Party. As the #CCP attempts to block Taiwan's participation at the World Health Assembly, I’m joining the call to ensure that our pro-democracy ally has a seat at the table. #LetTaiwanHelp\n\nTime and time again, the WHO serves as a willing pawn of the Chinese Communist Party. As we wrote earlier this month, the WHO must demonstrate true independence from the Chinese government. \n\nIt is alarming - but not surprising - that the WHO continues to serve as a pawn for the Chinese Communist Party. \n\nEric, did the Chinese Communist Party tell you to tweet this? \n\nI’m a Trump Republican. Here’s why I went to Joe Biden’s White House. Read my latest op-ed on how we can counter the Chinese Communist Party and create jobs at home in Pennsylvania. \n\nLast year the #ChinaTaskForce exposed #CCP-funded Confucius Institutes as a growing threat to both our national security and to the future of American research &amp; innovation. Rather than encourage propaganda, the Biden Admin should stand with the American people against the CCP. \n\nThere is no doubt that Huawei, a pawn of the #CCP, is a threat to our national security. The Senate should hold on Gov. Raimondo’s confirmation until the Biden Administration clarifies its intentions for Huawei and the Chinese Communist Party. \n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

But China is still the greatest threat to our nation. We need to act accordingly. \n\nThis is one of the most important missions in our new House majority. We will force @POTUS to wake up to the existential threat that is China. \n\nThank you, @BretBaier, for giving @sethmoulton and I the opportunity to send China a clear message: Republicans and Democrats are united in our mission to defend Taiwan. \n\nYesterday, I introduced a bill that would stop American tax dollars from going to Ukraine unless @POTUS certifies to Congress that Ukraine is not accepting aid from the CCP. The biggest global threat facing the U.S. is communist China. We cannot forget that fact.\n\nThe U.S. has proudly offered financial aid and intelligence support to Ukraine from day one. This has been with the mission of fighting Putin's senseless invasion and furthering our global interests. If Ukraine accepts aid from China, we fail that mission.\n\nAmerican taxpayer dollars were funneled to the very Chinese lab that is likely responsible for COVID-19. My amendment will defund all research labs in China, Russia, North Korea and Iran, including the WIV. This inexcusable mistake demands correction. \n\n.@POTUS hoped that an America distracted by his own series of crises wouldn't notice the attempt to cede power to the WHO. I noticed. Congress must now pass my bill to hold China accountable and keep American decision-making where it belongs: with the American people.\n\nThis week, the @WHO is considering two disastrous amendments proposed by @POTUS. The amendments would allow the WHO to unilaterally declare a public health crisis in the U.S. Yes, the same WHO who covered for China by denying their role in the origins of COVID-19.\n\nChina is closely watching how the West defends Ukraine. For the sake of the freedom-loving people of Taiwan, we must do everything in our power to defend the freedom-loving people of Ukraine. \n\nAn anxious world is looking for American leadership in a dangerous new era. We must unite to meet the threats from autocrats in Russia and China. \n\nChina, Iran and North Korea are watching with similarly malevolent intentions. They must see us respond firmly to Russia’s reprehensible aggression.\n\nThere is a smart, bipartisan path forward to counter the generational threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party. Speaker Pelosi’s bill is not on that path. \n\nThis is the White House Statement of Admin Policy on @SpeakerPelosi's China bill. You'll notice it doesn't even include the word \"China\"... This is why Republicans are united in opposition to this partisan, toothless bill. Simply put, it's not a genuine effort to counter China. \n\nIt is a moment for Congress to speak with one voice by passing a strong, bipartisan bill that advances America's competitiveness and holds China accountable. Yesterday, Speaker Pelosi introduced legislation that fails to meet those standards. Read my full statement  \n\n.@POTUS promised to restore America's \"respected leadership\" on the world stage. Instead, he put us on the international sidelines. This is the result... Russia threatening Ukraine China threatening Taiwan North Korea testing advanced missiles The Taliban making demands\n\n.@POTUS claims to have restored America's \"respected leadership on the world stage.\" The reality? -Russia is increasingly aggressive toward Ukraine -China is increasingly aggressive toward Taiwan -Al Qaeda and the Taliban are empowered -North Korea is testing hypersonic missiles \n\nTune in tonight at 5:30pm MT \/ 7:30pm ET as I join @TGowdySC to talk Russia, China, Iran, and everything else in the Intel Community. \n\nI have spent more time than anyone studying our enemies and the threats they pose. From China to the Ukraine, Africa to Afghanistan, I have seen first-hand the dangers we face.\n\nIf there is any issue that should be bipartisan, this is it. Why are Democrats blocking an amendment that would help end slave labor in China? \n\nFirst, the legislation aims to ban U.S. funding for gain-of-function research in China. Second, it demands a full accounting of how and where our tax dollars are going. And finally, it restricts government officials who intentionally mislead Congress.\n\nChina's missile tests are a chilling display of their capabilities and intentions. This needs to be a wake-up call for President Biden. \n\nChina is not a \"competitor,\" @POTUS. They're a fierce rival, and we need to start acting like it. \n\nWe're facing heightened threats from China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea. What is President Biden doing to protect Americans? \n\nSpeaker Pelosi's $3.5 trillion (really $5 trillion) plan will not... Rebuild our infrastructure Revamp our economy It will... Reduce our wages and jobs Increase our utility bills Drive our businesses overseas Raise our corporate tax rate beyond Communist China's\n\nGeneral Milley is liable for the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal. He is liable for the Kabul drone strike that killed civilians and is still unexplained. And now this. General Milley needs to clarify his calls with China. And then he needs to resign. \n\nLet's not forget: The consequences of President Biden's reckless withdrawal stretch beyond the borders of Afghanistan. Yesterday, China carried out assault drills near Taiwan. This disaster will cause allies to doubt our dependability and embolden enemies to test our resolve.\n\nChina’s growing influence on America is undeniable. Look no further than how Big Tech, media, and some politicians responded to the potential origins of COVID-19. The first step toward eliminating this influence? Acknowledging it. \n\nChina’s goal isn’t to become a peer competitor. It’s to become the single dominant force in the world. The American people, business leaders, and some politicians are starting to accept that reality. But if we don’t start taking action, we won’t be able to stop them. \n\nJoin me live on the @EveningEdit with @LizMacDonaldFOX at 4:35 pm MT \/ 6:35pm ET to talk about holding China accountable.\n\nChina is in the middle of a campaign to manipulate the hearts and minds of the American people.

Republicans are demanding transparency and justice on behalf of the American people. \n\nHouse Republicans are investigating the origins of COVID-19 and China's growing influence on corporate America. Why won't Democrats join our efforts to hold China accountable? \n\nChina has launched a campaign to manipulate the hearts and minds of the American people. American companies can't keep allowing themselves to be influenced by our greatest adversary. \n\nRepublicans on @HouseIntelComm are investigating China's malign influence on corporate America. We need to know more about how China is working to dictate our government and public perception. \n\nIt's no secret that China's mission is becoming the world's dominant superpower.

It jeopardizes America's interests.\n\nWe need to stop rewarding bad behavior and start holding China accountable. Republicans have a plan to do exactly that. This shouldn't be a partisan issue. I urge my Democratic colleagues to join us in demanding transparency and justice for the American people. \n\nIt was never unreasonable to consider that COVID-19 came from a lab in China. Still...  Left-wing media called it a conspiracy theory  Big Tech censored it  Activists in white lab coats dismissed it  Dems are still ignoring it It's time we start demanding answers.\n\nRepublicans offered eight pillars to demand transparency and justice from China. I can't understand why Democrats won't join these efforts to investigate the origins of COVID-19.\n\nThe CCP knowingly covered up information on the COVID-19 outbreak. Their actions directly impeded the world's ability to respond. This isn't a score-keeping exercise. This is about holding China accountable and achieving justice for those who suffered. \n\nU.S. taxpayer dollars shouldn't be funding dangerous research in foreign adversarial nations, like China. Making sure that never happens again is common sense. I'm proud to be an original cosponsor of @RepBradWenstrup's bill that would do exactly that. \n\nRepublicans have a plan to hold China accountable.  Declassify COVID-related intel  Ban gain of function research with China  Launch counterintelligence investigation  Sanction those involved in COVID coverup ...and more. We need answers. \n\n\"The Biden administration will not take a hard line with China about cooperating in an investigation into the origins of COVID-19...\" The American people need and deserve answers. This isn't how we're going to get them. \n\nThe WHO refuses to even acknowledge Taiwan as a country. At this point, the WHO investigating the origins of COVID is like China investigating itself. @GOPLeader is right - we can't keep funding this organization and rewarding bad behavior. \n\nIt's no surprise that China isn't going to be a helpful partner in determining the origins of COVID-19. We can and must get these answers ourselves. \n\nHouse Dems still haven't held a hearing on the origins of COVID-19 and China's potential role in its leak. That's why I joined @SteveScalise in writing a letter to Speaker Pelosi demanding that she allow investigations into the Wuhan lab. The American people deserve answers. \n\nPresident Biden was right to have a sense of urgency on the campaign trail. Now, Democrats need to walk the walk. Speaker Pelosi must allow House investigations into the origins of COVID-19 and China's potential role in its leak. \n\nChina isn't going to be helpful or forthcoming in determining the origin of COVID-19. That can't surprise anyone. But we still need to move forward, make up for lost time, and find answers. We owe that to everyone who suffered from this virus. \n\nThe Chinese state media is turning on Dr. Fauci because he's being rational. There is significant circumstantial evidence that COVID-19 leaked from a Wuhan lab. That warrants an investigation. It's no surprise the CCP-controlled media isn't happy. \n\nWe have to answer the most important question facing the world right now: Is the Chinese Communist Party responsible for unleashing COVID-19? \n\nWe wasted a year dismissing this very real, very troubling possibility as a conspiracy theory. I'm glad to see this narrative changing, but we need to start making up for lost time and pressuring China for answers. \n\nDid COVID-19 leak from a lab in China? Were American tax dollars funding research in that lab? These questions are too important not to have answers.\n\nSome important things we know for a fact: -China denied the WHO access to raw data from the Wuhan lab -China destroyed COVID-19 lab samples -China edited a final version of the WHO's report on COVID-19's origins We need an investigation, answers, and accountability. \n\nThere is significant circumstantial evidence that the COVID-19 outbreak came from a Wuhan lab. Biden needs to put more pressure on China. We can't trust them at their word, and the origin of this disease is too important of a question not to get answers. \n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

If you are not with family, as I was in 1980 during my Missionary Service in Taiwan, I hope that you can still gather with others and have a meaningful holiday. Happy Thanksgiving. \n\nNow hearing from @robertcobrien on conservative climate policy. Thank you for taking the time to answer questions from the audience about energy independence, China, and nuclear and permitting reform. \n\nI am ecstatic that my bill, the TAIPEI Act, opened the door for the U.S. to strengthen our ties with Taiwan. Taiwan is Utah’s 5⃣th largest trading partner and this would be a massive victory for Utah businesses — from tech &amp; medical devices to mining &amp; ag. \n\nRussia and China are on an unapologetic strategy of energy dominance, using none of the innovative technologies that make our energy cleaner in the United States. Let's get this right and with bipartisan support. \n\nHigh-level visits to Taiwan show US support and these visits are US policy as reaffirmed by my bill, the TAIPEI Act. Threats from China to the Taiwanese people are intolerable.\n\nTomorrow, I am speaking with Taiwan's @bikhim at @RepChrisStewart Security Summit. Recent events show the importance of America’s partnership with Taiwan. I have long called for fair treatment of Taiwan internationally and deeper ties between our democracies.\n\nThe Speaker of the House should not back down to Chinese threats, she should expand the trip and make it bipartisan. Democracies must stand together against intimidation. \n\nEnergy policies today will impact us for decades to come. The US must lead through energy independence, exporting clean resources to our allies, and holding China and Russia accountable for their carbon emissions. \n\nToday, I had the opportunity in a @HouseCommerce hearing to express my concern with foreign influence in research institutions through China’s Thousand Talents Program and urged my colleagues to support my Fix NIH Research Act to prevent these nefarious influence operations.\n\nPleased to see this news. My bill, the TAIPEI Act, signed into law in 2020 called for deeper bilateral trade and economic relations between the United States and Taiwan—preferably a free trade agreement. \n\nMy thoughts on the House vote I took today about price gouging of gas. I believe we can have affordable and clean energy. Yet, attacking American production while letting China and Russia off the hook won’t solve the global emissions problem we face. #utpol \n\nTwo years ago the WHO failed in its stated mission due in large part to the influence of the CCP. The organization needs reform and step one is ensuring that partners like Taiwan that saw the COVID outbreak coming get a seat at the table. \n\nA new report says the U.S. must go on the offensive to counter China’s coercion of the UN and claim sovereignty over Taiwan. My bill, the Taiwan International Solidarity Act, which passed the House, would incentivize this and I urge the Senate to pass it. \n\nI am disappointed that House Democratic Leadership blocked debate or a vote on my amendment to bring transparency to how US taxpayer dollars are going to use in China. This bill is a massive amount of spending with no checks to ensure the money won’t just benefit China. \n\nAlongside my friend @RepBurgessOwens, we discussed ways for the US to support Taiwan internationally and strengthen Utahns relationships with the Taiwanese.\n\nToday I was honored to lead the first meeting with the VP of Taiwan @ChingteLai on his trip to the US. Utah and Taiwan have many ties, ties I have worked to strengthen during my time in Congress. \n\nCompanies can’t have it both ways. There are serious human rights violations occurring in China that private companies cannot turn their backs on. It is why I signed this letter with my @HouseCommerce colleagues to hold them accountable. \n\nAlong with my Fix Nondisclosure of Influence in Health (NIH) Research Act, Energy and Commerce Committee Republicans are working to combat influence from the Chinese Communist Party in American medical research through a number of bills. \n\nI am deeply concerned by foreign influence in research institutions through China’s Thousand Talents Program. My bill, the Fix Nondisclosure of Influence in Health (NIH) Research Act would shine a light on these influence operations. \n\nChina has been engaged in threatening and oppressive behavior, highlighted by its actions in Hong Kong and Xinjiang and the disappearance of Peng Shuai. The Administration is right to announce a diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Olympics in Beijing. \n\nHad the pleasure of meeting with @EnesKanter and my friend @jooeysiiu to discuss our efforts to stand with Hong Kong, support Taiwan, and free Uyghurs. I commend Enes for using his platform to highlight China’s human rights abuses. \n\nCOP Day Three Update! The big highlights from Monday were discussions on #natgas plants backing up renewable power and how the Taiwanese manage their energy demands. No socks to show but stay tuned for tomorrow's update! \n\nI agree with this statement from @RepBera and @RepSteveChabot. Our bill with @GerryConnolly, the Taiwan International Solidarity Act, recognizes this manipulation of Resolution 2758 and works to push back on China's attempts to distort UN language &amp; procedures regarding Taiwan. \n\nThe TAIPEI Act, which I introduced and was signed into law last year reaffirmed and strengthened our relationship with Taiwan as both the Trump &amp; Biden Administrations have worked to fulfill its mandate. The Administration must continue to work to deter Chinese aggression.\n\nI am deeply concerned by the recent Chinese aggression towards Taiwan. For 42 years the Taiwan Relations Act has solidified the unshakable bond between our two countries. I stand with our democratic partner \n\nThe Chinese Communist Party has 100 years of gross violations of human rights—including some of the worst atrocities of the 20th Century, as well as the current genocide against #Uyghurs &amp; oppression of #HongKong. I urge @SpeakerPelosi to bring this resolution for a vote swiftly. \n\nLast month I joined colleagues in sending a letter to @SecBlinken requesting Taiwan receive our surplus vaccines and today I was pleased to receive a letter and beautiful picture from Ambassador  @bikhim. I'm grateful for our partnership— we're in this together! 🤝 \n\n#TaiwanIsACountry 🤝\n\nThe #COVID19 outbreak was exacerbated because the World Health Organization ignored warnings from Taiwan about human-to-human transmission of the virus. Today, I join with my bipartisan colleagues asking the @WHO to #LetTaiwanHelp.  \n\nThe pressure from the CCP is seen in @rthk_enews's viral video — a senior @WHO advisor was unwilling to answer a question about Taiwan’s handling of the outbreak of COVID-19 &amp; eventually stated “we have already talked about China… [and] all of the different areas of China.” \n\nToday I'm introducing the bipartisan Taiwan Solidarity Act with @GerryConnolly, @RepSires, @MarioDB, @RepBera and @RepSteveChabot. The bill adds to the TAIPEI Act to counter these attempts from the Chinese Communist Party. #utpol (2\/2) More below: \n\nThe TAIPEI Act greatly strengthened our relationship with Taiwan as both the Trump &amp; Biden Administrations have worked to fulfill its mandate. Unfortunately, China has since mounted pressure on international organizations to claim that Taiwan is part of China. (1\/2)\n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

This administration’s continued focus on international challenges that China has co-opted like climate change undermines the urgency we must act with to advance the interests of Americans.\n\nHardworking Americans deserve an economy that sets them up for success. This means — Fighting inflation &amp; lowering the cost of living Securing American energy independence Strengthening our supply chain &amp; ending our dependence on China This is our #CommitmentToAmerica\n\nIt's not the time for divisive rhetoric. We must be focused on getting our nation back on track by reining in runaway spending and bringing down inflation, securing our border, and ensuring our military has the tools they need to deter China and other foreign adversaries.\n\nDiscussions during my trip to the Indo-Pacific confirmed that the U.S. must build &amp; retain purposeful commitments to the region to counter adversaries. We must maximize the integration of key partners to compete with China. Read more in my recent piece. \n\n@CSIS @GregPoling The United States must defend the importance of free commerce in the South China Sea &amp; continue to reject China's illegal territorial claims. We have upheld freedom of the seas from our earliest days as a maritime nation. Join my discussion with @GregPoling at #SCSconference12 \n\nJoin me this morning at 9:00AM at the 12th Annual South China Sea Conference with @CSIS. We'll be discussing challenges and opportunities for the region this year with @GregPoling. Tune in below  \n\nThe SPR exists to serve Americans, not foreign adversaries, and sending our strategic stockpiles to China will only exacerbate our nation’s energy crisis. Read out my full letter to Secretary Granholm below. \n\nWhile Americans continue to feel pain at the pump, U.S. crude oil is being sent to adversaries like China. Today, I sent a letter to Sec. Granholm regarding the DOE’s management of the SPR with the ongoing depletion of the nation's petroleum reserves. \n\nThe Biden Administration’s divest to invest strategy depletes our naval fleet in a pivotal decade. The defeat of this amendment ensures that our military is equipped, and continues to grow in the face of adversaries like China.\n\n\"Congress must address the shortcomings of the Biden administration’s policies toward China, making the hard choices that the Biden administration continues to avoid.\" Check out my latest piece in @defense_news below. \n\nI cannot overstate the importance of investing in our Navy to deter China and secure the future of our naval forces. \n\nChina is the pacing challenge, yet this plan cuts our Navy and Marine Corps’ abilities to carry out their missions, would put our aircraft carrier strike groups at risk, shrink the fleet during a critical decade, and underinvest in the future force.\n\nBoth @RepMikeRogersAL and I are deeply concerned with Pres. Biden’s first 30 Year Shipbuilding Plan. Reducing our naval power will put our warfighters in a dangerous position against China’s growing naval forces and undermine our ability to compete in the maritime domain.\n\nOur nation’s defense budget must account for inflation. In a time where countries like China and Russia are growing stronger, it’s critical that we have a robust defense budget that strengthens our national security and keeps the U.S. in competition with our adversaries.\n\nThis morning, I questioned SecDef Austin and General Milley on the inadequate budget request for FY23. We must build our naval fleet with the urgency required to deter China and other adversaries this decade - not 20 years from now. \n\nI’m proud to join my colleagues in calling for Pres. Biden to increase the defense budget. As China &amp; Russia’s malign activity escalates, we must ensure that our warfighters receive the equipment and resources they need to defend the U.S. &amp; our friends. \n\nProud to join my colleagues in this effort to urge Pres. Biden to increase defense spending for FY2023. With growing national security threats from adversaries like China &amp; Russia, it's critical that we have the proper funding to protect the interests of the U.S. &amp; our allies. \n\nAllowing China to believe they have control over this war is beyond dangerous. Hopefully, Biden made it clear to Xi what is at stake. Any interference by China to enable Putin’s vicious behavior in Ukraine should be met with strong sanctions by the U.S. \n\nI introduced the World Deserves to Know Act with @RepStefanik to get to the truth behind the pandemic's origins with an investigation that China continues to block. If Democrats are serious about getting tough on China, why would they reject this proposal that does just that?\n\nYesterday, Democrats rejected the inclusion of my amendment in Speaker Pelosi's COMPETES Act that would hold China accountable for their role in the COVID-19 pandemic. The world deserves answers to this pandemic that has now caused fear and disruption for over two years.\n\nSpeaker Pelosi now requires Members of Congress to wear N95 or KN95 masks on the House Floor, but the masks provided to each Member’s office are Chinese-made. Shouldn’t we be promoting American-made PPE? Read my full letter to Speaker Pelosi below. \n\nCountering China will require a consolidated, whole-of-government approach. In the short term, we must shore up deterrence to preclude near term conflict: only then can we win the long game. Check out my latest piece in @defense_news  \n\nTo be clear: the Chinese Communist Party is not a friend of the US. Last night's summit was a missed chance to reassert the US on a global stage. The CCP poses a clear threat to our nation - one that must be taken seriously. Read my full statement here: \n\nThis exercise was a mistake by China - they’ve shown their hand. If any nation had doubts about Chinese intentions, this China-Russia teaming shows they will do whatever it takes to replace U.S. global primacy.\n\nThis joint exercise is a message for what may be coming. As Russia and China continue to deepen their relationship, we march closer to another global showdown. \n\nHypersonic weapons will render Ballistic Missile Defense obsolete, returning the world to an era of Mutually Assured Destruction. China’s recent test of hypersonic weapons threatens to destabilize the existing deterrence paradigm. The US must match capabilities to ensure peace.\n\nThe World Deserves to Know Act would sanction key Chinese officials until a free and fair investigation of the Wuhan Lab is allowed. Our bill will also block taxpayer dollars from funding dangerous research in China and elevate Taiwan’s status in the WHO.\n\nTime is running out to discover COVID-19’s origins. China cannot be allowed to block an investigation any longer. We need to pass my bill with @RepStefanik , the World Deserves to Know Act, to uncover the truth behind the pandemic. \n\nPresident Biden agrees. When it comes to the origins of COVID-19, the world deserves answers. Thank you to my colleague @RepStefanik for joining me in standing up to Communist China and demanding the truth! \n\nThe debacle in Afghanistan has emboldened our near-peer rivals, such as China and Russia. Now more than ever, we need a military strong enough to secure peace through deterrence.\n\nIf President Biden is serious about meeting the threats of China and Russia, then why did he refuse to request the funding necessary to meet the requirement of the National Defense Strategy?\n\nMy bill would sanction key Chinese officials and pave the way to uncover the truth about COVID-19's origins. Scientists already warn that time to study this pandemic is running out. Biden must act quickly to discover the origins of COVID-19 and to prevent future pandemics.\n\nEarlier this week, I joined the @HudsonInstitute with @RepGallagher to discuss challenges facing the U.S. shipbuilding and repair industry &amp; the need for immediate action to build and maintain our Navy to keep up with the increasing threats posed by China. \n\nIt is an honor to be appointed to the China Task Force by @GOPLeader. We must stand United in countering China’s malign influence and activities at home and abroad. Please click below to read my full statement. \n\nMounting evidence continues to indicate the Wuhan Institute of Virology as the pandemic's likely origin. Yesterday, I spoke on the House Floor on the need for an investigation, and how my bill, \"The World Deserves to Know Act,\" holds China accountable. \n\nUncovering the origins of COVID-19 is critically important to preventing future pandemics. We cannot allow China to continue suppressing the truth. The World Deserves to Know what happened. Thank you @FoxFriendsFirst and @jillianmele for having me on. \n\n\"China’s economy is highly intertwined with the rest of the world. Diplomatic pressure is going to be surface level, at best. We must exert targeted economic pressure -namely sanctions- on key figures within the CCP.\" \n\nWhy is China working so hard to stop an investigation when they claim there’s nothing to hide? Enough of the games. After losing millions of lives, the world deserves the truth, not China’s lies. #WuhanLab \n\nThis is big. If we continue on the Biden Administration’s course, our rivals’ militaries will be more powerful than ours. The Biden Administration clearly has no problem spending money. Why are we cutting the defense budget as we stare down threats like China, Russia, and Iran? \n\nThis morning, I joined @FinnertyUSA to discuss how the World Deserves to Know Act will get to the bottom of China’s role in COVID-19’s origin so we can make sure this never happens again. #WuhanLab \n\nEarlier today, I spoke with my colleagues in the @RepublicanStudy Committee on my bill, the “The World Deserves to Know Act” which would sanction Chinese officials until they allow an investigation into the Wuhan Institute of Virology as a possible origin for COVID-19. #WuhanLab \n\n\"We cannot allow China to impede a free and fair investigation into the origins of COVID-19,\" Wittman said in a statement. \"Nor can we tolerate China’s suppression of information which could prove critically important to preventing future pandemics.” \n\nToday, I introduced \"The World Deserves to Know Act\" with @RepStefanik to hold China accountable and pave the way to uncover the truth about COVID-19's origins. This is not about partisan politics - this is about national security. \n\nWith $6 trillion going elsewhere, we supposedly cannot afford anything more than cheap talk. This is an unserious budget that fails to deliver the resources we need to counter the serious threats posed by China, Russia, North Korea, Iran and others. \n\nThe #ColonialPipeline hack is bad. But if the United States fails to shore up our #cybersecurity, a conflict with China, Russia, or Iran would see attacks like these devastate our economy.\n\nThis is #NatSec 101: we do not hand state secrets to our adversaries. Check out my conversation with @JohnFBachman @newsmax about the unacceptable leak by Honeywell, and my thoughts on how we ought to move forward to protect our nation in #GPC with China. \n\nPresident Biden is right. Other nations, especially China, must reduce their carbon emissions as the United States has and is. However, the Paris Accord let’s China off the hook. We need an agreement to hold China accountable. #JointAddress\n\nTough talk on China isn’t enough. Our military needs the funding necessary to meet the threat posed by China, not the cuts proposed by President Biden. #JointAddress\n\nI highlighted during yesterday’s HASC hearing my concerns about Russian area denial in the Black Sea. If we cancel routine operations due to the possibility of danger, does freedom of navigation exist? We do not back down in the South China Sea, nor should we back down here.\n\nAre you really dismissing the threat posed by China as \"fearmongering?\" I'd like to invite you to attend a classified briefing on the enormity of the threat we face and the consequences of failure. \n\nThese cuts would be nothing short of catastrophic. China's goal is nothing less than the complete destruction of the United States. They will not stop simply because you all would choose to ignore them. \n\nAs AI and Unmanned platforms start working their way onto the battlespace, @DeptofDefense needs to explain to us: what are the rules of employment? Autonomy in the kill-chain? Legal standards for unmanned reflex responses? Will China and Russia play by the same rules?\n\n“This shipbuilding budget is a litmus test for how serious this Administration plans on taking China. I hope they are serious. I will continue to fight for a stronger, more capable Navy as we continue to deter our adversaries.” You can read more here: \n\nOur goal must always be peace through deterrence. @HASCRepublicans and I are advocating for a Navy capable of deterring China in the Indo-Pacific.

The planned reduction in fleet size is not just about loss of capacity, but loss of capability in the timeframe when the threat from China is the greatest, known as the ‘Davidson Window.’\n\nIt was great sitting down with @wardcarroll last week to discuss the threat we face from China and the Navy's budget and shipbuilding plan! \n\nI urge the America COMPETES Act Conference Committee to include language in the final legislation that would prohibit American Rescue Plan funds from purchasing Chinese equipment and safeguarding American technology infrastructure.\n\nWe cannot continue to allow our taxpayer dollars be used to purchase equipment from firms that are well-documented and complicit in the People’s Republic of China's espionage campaign against the United States.\n\nI joined @rep_stevewomack in urging COMPETES Act conferees to include language from the American Telecommunications Security Act that would prohibit American Rescue Plans funds from being used to purchase equipment from Chinese firms Huawei &amp; ZTE. : \n\nThe current budget plan calls for decommissioning 24 ships while building only 8 new ones. That is a net loss of 16 ships to the Navy while China continues to grow its fleet and capacities. \n\nLastly, the Navy has no strategy. Stop saying you do, because if you did you would be able to explain how this Fleet size will allow us to defend Taiwan. 7\/7\n\nChina is not a “pacing challenge” when they will soon have double the size of our Navy. We are losing 1000+ VLS cells, with NO PLAN to replace them.

We must do more to protect the data of the American people and keep our country safe online. \n\nVirginia hospitals often face shortages of essential generic medications — forcing us to rely on foreign producers for the drugs Americans need. I’m proud the CHIPS and Science Act includes language authorizing research to address those shortages and boost our supply of drugs.\n\nAs a former case officer, I understand the danger of the Chinese Communist Party spying on American citizens and companies. I’m glad to see the U.S. Department of Justice respond to this egregious attempt to obstruct justice and interfere with the rights of Americans. \n\nWith new reports of planned surveillance by TikTok, laws to protect American companies from foreign threats and protect American data from Chinese espionage are as important as ever.

As a former intelligence officer, I have long had concerns about the use of TikTok. In 2020, the U.S. House passed my bill to ban the app on TSA phones. \n\nNEW: @Forbes reveals a concerted effort by TikTok to conduct unauthorized surveillance of American citizens. We cannot afford to ease our vigilance against operations potentially originating from the Chinese Communist Party. Americans deserve answers. \n\nI’m calling on U.S. House leadership to bring my bipartisan JOBS Act up for a vote. With the CHIPS and Science Act now law, our nation is investing in domestic semiconductor manufacturing and research.

How this law is pushing companies to expand operations in Virginia and lowering costs for consumers: \n\nOnly 12% of semiconductors — or microchips — are made in the United States. But chips are essential to our cars, cell phones, household appliances, and much more.

Our @CECCgov hearing today uplifted the stories of many of the victims who are suffering behind the glamor and spectacle of these Games. \n\nIt's a disgrace to see sports organizations capitulate to the Chinese government in this way. The issue of #PengShuai's freedom and safety is not a political statement. It's a serious human rights matter, and I applaud those who are raising awareness. \n\nI’m deeply concerned by reports that Saudi Arabia is preparing to deport two Uyghurs back to China where they are at risk of arbitrary detention and torture. The Saudi government should immediately clarify the status of these detainees. \n\nI've helped lead the effort in the House to hold the Chinese government accountable for human rights abuses, including successfully passing into law our bipartisan Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. \n\nThis is important reporting on the extensive disinformation campaign that the Chinese government is supporting on social media. These pages exist across platforms and are spreading propaganda on issues ranging from COVID to forced labor in Xinjiang. \n\nWe just passed our bipartisan bill to keep goods made with forced labor off U.S. shelves and hold the Chinese government accountable. The forced labor of Uyghurs has infected global supply chains, and U.S. companies and consumers must not be complicit. \n\nThe Chinese government's mass imprisonment and forced labor of Uyghurs has infected global supply chains. I'm proud that the House has taken decisive, bipartisan action to keep products made with forced labor off our store shelves and hold the PRC accountable. \n\nNEW: @SpeakerPelosi announced the House will take up legislation to defend human rights in China, including my bipartisan resolution condemning the IOC’s role in covering up #PengShuai’s disappearance. We’ll also take action on @RepMcGovern’s Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act. \n\nThe IOC’s collaboration with Chinese government officials to cover up the disappearance of Peng Shuai calls into question the organization's willingness to protect the rights and safety of Olympic athletes from this major human rights violator. \n\nThe Chinese govt abuses technology to surveil &amp; censor critics and crack down on oppressed populations like Uyghurs. At yesterday's @CECCgov hearing, I spoke about keeping Americans safe, especially during the Olympics, &amp; ensuring U.S. tech isn't involved in PRC's surveillance. \n\nThis is what happens when athletes speak out against the Chinese government’s brutal treatment of Uyghurs, Tibetans, &amp; Hong Kongers. @NBA &amp; @iocmedia can’t continue to look past repression &amp; genocide by the PRC.

Their Abortion on Demand Until Birth Act nationalizes abortions for all nine months, making America just as radical as China and North Korea.\n\nChina is the greatest threat facing America today. But we cannot beat them with record high spending and more regulatory barriers that hurt competition. We need to ease regulatory burdens, unleash innovation, secure supply chains, &amp; ensure jobs are created in America. \n\nThe Senate is again voting for an abortion bill that is more radical that Roe and forces an extreme agenda on every American.

We cannot rely on Chinese supply chains for Democrats’ rush-to-green agenda and let Europe’s energy crisis be America's future.\n\nAmerica should be leading to restore our energy dominance and bolster our geopolitical power. We should be flipping the switch on OUR energy production—not lurching to a rush-to-green agenda that makes America reliant on Chinese supply chains.\n\nToday @HouseCommerce should be having a hearing on American energy security and how we can aid our allies by producing more oil and natural gas and increasing LNG exports. Instead, the topic is on forcing electric vehicles, which will increase American dependence on China. \n\nIf President Biden and the Democrats truly wanted to make America more competitive and beat China, they would abandon their destructive, tax and spend agenda and work with us to reform our burdensome permitting, licensing, and regulatory regimes.\n\nEvery plan we’ve seen from the Biden administration and Democrats tries to copy China’s own dangerous path of centralized industrial policy and massive government handouts.

This law prohibited individuals of Chinese descent from immigrating to the US and was coupled with many other discriminatory laws.\n\n140 years ago today, the foul tides of racism and xenophobia prevailed with the signing of the Chinese Exclusion Act. This blatant act of discrimination became part of a larger movement to isolate, control and eliminate Chinese Americans who lived in and helped build our country.\n\nPleased that the bipartisan legislation @RepDustyJohnson and I introduced was referenced during the #StateOfTheUnion. Our Ocean Shipping Reform Act addresses the issues plaguing our supply chains, protects American jobs, and corrects trade imbalances with China and other nations.\n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

This important law will drive innovation, create good-paying jobs, lower prices for families, and make our country safer and more secure for years to come. \n\nTwo years ago, I introduced the original CHIPS Act to address an urgent economic &amp; national security threat — America’s decline in the strategically important semiconductor industry. Last week, I was proud to be there as we sent the #CHIPSandScience Act to @POTUS to be signed. \n\nAll Sacramentans &amp; Americans have felt the impact of the chips shortage. Maybe it’s buying a car, waiting months for an appliance, or paying more for a cell phone. This bill will create resilient supply chains, but will also create good paying jobs &amp; lower costs for families.\n\nToday, the House passed the #CHIPSandScience Act—a bipartisan bill based on my CHIPS Act which reasserts American leadership in the critical semiconductor industry. Semiconductors are the fundamental building blocks of the 21st century economy—we all depend on these microchips. \n\nThe bicameral Conference Committee on the #AmericaCOMPETES Act and USICA met to discuss this critical package, which will include my CHIPS for America Act — which will establish a roadmap for reasserting American leadership in the strategically important semiconductor industry. \n\nLed my colleagues in urging Congressional leadership to quickly send the $52B necessary to fund my bill, the CHIPS for America Act, to @POTUS' desk for signing. This bill would help restore semiconductor manufacturing back to American soil and secure this critical supply chain. \n\nThe CHIPS Act funding in #AmericaCOMPETES is bipartisan, supported by the Biden Administration, will help workers, and increase our research and manufacturing capacity. I look forward to working with @SpeakerPelosi to pass it as soon as possible.\n\n#AmericaCOMPETES includes the full $52 billion we need to comprehensively implement the CHIPS Act — my bill that established a roadmap for reasserting American leadership in the semiconductor industry.\n\nI’m a proud author of the CHIPS for America Act, which established a roadmap for reasserting American leadership in the important semiconductor industry.

The package includes $52B of investments based on my bill, the CHIPS for America Act—which will reassert American leadership in the semiconductor industry. \n\nChip shortage is indeed a crisis. My bill, the CHIPS Act, will make needed investments in this essential hardware — allowing our domestic industry to continue to innovate &amp; thrive. The U.S. must maintain the ability to produce the hardware that our high-tech economy depends on. \n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

My statement with @RepSteveChabot @SenMarkey @SenatorRomney: \n\nGreat news! Over 750 high-paying tech jobs are coming to #CA07. This exciting announcement comes on the heels of the #CHIPSandScienceAct - a law that will further catalyze manufacturing and research across the U.S. and in #SacramentoCounty. \n\nWe need to ensure more of our products are made in America by American workers. That's why I voted for the #CHIPSandScienceAct. This law will boost manufacturing here at home, strength our economy, and create good-paying jobs.\n\nThe #CHIPSandScience Act will bring good-paying jobs to #SacramentoCounty. This law will lower costs for American families and small businesses, reduce reliance on foreign countries, and strengthen our position as the world leader in technology and science. \n\nI'm introducing bipartisan legislation to strengthen U.S. expertise on China. If we are to outcompete China and win the geostrategic competition of the 21st century, we need a much better understanding of the country’s language, history, and institutions. \n\nIt’s critical that more of our products are made in America by American workers. The #CHIPSandScienceAct will catalyze manufacturing and research across the U.S., including in #SacramentoCounty which is the proud home to several world-leading semiconductor companies.\n\nI just voted YES on the #CHIPSandScienceAct to lower costs for #SacramentoCounty families, boost American manufacturing, and strengthen our global competitiveness. This historic bill now heads to @POTUS for his signature into law.\n\nFinally, my bipartisan Taiwan Fellowship Act passed the House last night as part of the #FY23NDAA. This bill develops tomorrow’s #Taiwan experts in the U.S. government and better informs our foreign policy towards the Indo-Pacific. \n\nAlso passed in the #FY23NDAA is my bipartisan Countering China Economic Coercion Act, which will create the first-ever interagency task force to better address Beijing’s economic coercion, while expanding cooperation with the private sector and our allies. \n\nMy Taiwan Peace and Stability Act strengthens the U.S.-#Taiwan partnership by enhancing deterrence over a cross-Strait conflict, supporting Taiwan's participation in the international community, and advancing our economic ties together.  #FY23NDAA \n\nGreat news: my Taiwan Peace and Stability Act passed last night as an amendment to the #FY23NDAA! This bipartisan legislation strengthens the U.S.-Taiwan partnership and enhances deterrence over Beijing attempts to intimidate and isolate #Taiwan.\n\nIf we want to effectively counter China’s growing aggression in the Indo-Pacific, we must also focus on increasing diplomatic and development resources to the region, not just military assistance. My full letter in @nytimes: \n\nFor decades, U.S. administrations across both parties have routinely underinvested in our diplomatic and aid assistance for the Indo-Pacific, setting the stage for China to expand its influence and attempt to define the rules of the region.\n\nI'm glad to see the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act go into effect, legislation I proudly voted for last year. We must continue to hold the People’s Republic of China accountable for the ongoing genocide committed against the Uyghur people and other Muslim minorities. \n\n#Taiwan has been an historic partner on global health security, helping lead the fight against AIDS, tuberculosis, and #COVID19. I join @SecBlinken in calling on the @WHO to invite Taiwan to participate in the World Health Assembly as an observer. It’s time to #LetTaiwanHelp. \n\nDelighted to lead a bipartisan @HouseForeign dinner with @bikhim, Taiwan’s Representative to the United States. We discussed the strong U.S. support for the people of #Taiwan, Russia’s invasion of #Ukraine, and regional issues in the Indo-Pacific. \n\nConcerning reports. Amid China’s growing reach, we must strengthen our own presence and diplomatic partnerships with Pacific Island nations. We can start by passing the BLUE Pacific and OCEANIA Acts. \n\nSpeaking live with @world_affairs and @RaySuarezNews on pressing global security challenges, including Russia’s increased aggression towards Ukraine and how we can combat China’s growing economic coercion. \n\nIt’s critical that we develop dynamic partnerships with our friends and allies in the Indo-Pacific. My bipartisan \"Taiwan Fellowship Act\" develops tomorrow’s Taiwan experts in the U.S. government and better informs our foreign policy towards the region. \n\nBeijing continues its relentless campaign to isolate #Taiwan from the world stage. My “The Taiwan Peace and Stability Act\" strengthens our support for Taiwan and enhances deterrence over Beijing’s growing military provocations around Taiwan. \n\nIncluded is my bipartisan \"Countering China Economic Coercion Act.\" This bill creates an interagency task force to ensure the U.S. is better prepared to address China's harmful economic coercion that is regularly used against countries and companies. \n\nCongratulations to Nicholas Burns for being sworn in as Ambassador to the People’s Republic of China. The U.S.-China relationship is the most consequential of the 21st century. Amb Burns will be a strong advocate for U.S. interests, and I look forward to working with him. \n\nThe People’s Republic of China uses nefarious and coercive economic practices to target both countries and companies. My \"Countering China Economic Coercion Act\" will ensure the U.S. is working in a coordinated fashion to deter China's economic coercion. \n\nAfter an arbitral tribunal rejected in 2016 PRC's maritime claims in the #SouthChinaSea, the @StateDept's study further shows Beijing's claims are not grounded in international law. I call on the PRC to follow international laws and cease its bullying behavior in the SCS. \n\nI'm proud that THREE of my amendments were included in the #NDAA. My amendments 1) bolster our global health security to prevent future pandemics, 2) strengthen Taiwan's defense against Chinese aggression, and 3) help our Afghan partners and allies who assisted U.S. operations.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party has consistently demonstrated its flagrant disregard for human rights and freedoms of speech, religion, and assembly. The CCP forcefully disappears its citizens, committed genocide against Uyghur Muslims, &amp; violently suppresses democracy in Hong Kong.\n\nThe Peoples Republic of China has a responsibility to immediately provide verifiable evidence of Peng’s safety and whereabouts. There must also be a formal and independent investigation into Peng’s accusations of sexual abuse by a former PRC senior official.\n\nAs Chair of the @HouseForeign Subcommittee on Asia, I join the global community in expressing my deep concern over the continued disappearance of Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai. \n\nAs the world’s two largest economies, the U.S. and China must responsibly manage the competition and differences between our two nations to avoid miscalculation.\n\n50 yrs ago today, the U.N. General Assembly adopted Resolution 2758. Beijing has increasingly used a manipulated interpretation of the resolution to ostracize the people of #Taiwan from the international system. My full statement: \n\nThe bipartisan \"Countering China Economic Coercion Act\" will create the first-ever interagency task force to better address Beijing’s economic coercion, while expanding cooperation with the private sector and U.S. allies. \n\nBeijing increasingly uses nefarious and coercive economic practices that threaten our partners in the Indo-Pacific and our own national security and economic well-being. Today, I’m introducing legislation to deter these actions and hold China accountable.\n\nAs Chair of the @HouseForeign Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, I extend my congratulations and warmest wishes to the people of Taiwan on your National Day. \n\nThe #FY22NDAA also strengthens our abilities to confront growing threats facing our nation at home and abroad: improving deterrence against cyberattacks, addressing strategic challenges posed by China, combatting climate change, and reinvigorating our global alliances.\n\nMy second amendment supports Taiwan adopting an asymmetric defense strategy. #Taiwan remains a critical partner to peace &amp; security in the Indo-Pacific but faces increasing military pressure from Beijing. I’m proud to lead Congressional support for Taiwan in the #FY22NDAA.\n\nOne of the key planks of the Peace and Stability Act is to take a very strategic approach to strengthening Taiwan’s participation in international organizations. I don’t think we have done a great job here and I think China has done a pretty masterful job. @GMFAsia \n\nWhat’s changed isn't how the U.S. looks at our relationship with #Taiwan. What's changed is China's posture. Xi Jinping’s aggressiveness is forcing us to rethink the ability of the people of Taiwan to choose their own direction- and how we support them. My remarks @GMFAsia. \n\nAs the Chair of the @HouseForeign Subcmte on Asia, I welcome the nominations of Nicholas Burns as ambassador to #China and Rahm Emanuel as ambassador to #Japan. Both bring decades of public service experience and will be strong advocates for U.S. interests in the Indo-Pacific. \n\nI support our European partners’ efforts to further engage with Taiwan, including Lithuania's decision to open a Taiwan representative office. We must continue to oppose Beijing’s efforts to isolate #Taiwan from the international community. My statement: \n\nI condemn the PRC's continued arbitrary detention and recent sentencing of Michael Spavor. People are not bargaining chips, and Beijing must cease its use of hostage diplomacy. I support Canada's call for the immediate release of #MichaelSpavor and #MichaelKovrig. \n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

We came to listen &amp; learn; we left inspired by their courage. \n\nIt was also my high honor to receive from President @iingwen of Taiwan the Order of Propitious Clouds with Special Grand Cordon: a symbol of our treasured friendship. Make no mistake: America remains unwavering in our commitment to the people of Taiwan– now &amp; for decades to come. \n\nOur delegation had the distinct privilege of meeting with the President of Taiwan @Iingwen today. We discussed how America &amp; Taiwan can deepen our economic ties, further strengthen our security partnership &amp; defend our shared democratic values. \n\nOur Congressional delegation had the great privilege of meeting with the Vice President of the Legislative Yuan Tsai Chi-chang here in Taipei. We reiterated our ironclad support for Taiwan’s democracy, including on matters of security &amp; stability, economic growth and governance. \n\nIt is my great and humble privilege to accept on behalf of the Congress the Order of Propitious Clouds with Special Grand Cordon: a symbol of America’s strong and enduring friendship with Taiwan. Join me &amp; President @iingwen for this special presentation. \n\nOur visit reiterates that America stands with Taiwan: a robust, vibrant democracy and our important partner in the Indo-Pacific. \n\nBy traveling to Taiwan, we honor our commitment to democracy: reaffirming that the freedoms of Taiwan — and all democracies — must be respected. Read my opinion piece in the @washingtonpost on why I’m leading a Congressional delegation to Taiwan. \n\nThe United States continues to oppose unilateral efforts to change the status quo. Read my full statement on our Congressional delegation’s visit to Taiwan here: \n\nOur visit is one of several Congressional delegations to Taiwan – and it in no way contradicts longstanding United States policy, guided by the Taiwan Relations Act of 1979, U.S.-China Joint Communiques and the Six Assurances.\n\nAmerica’s solidarity with the 23 million people of Taiwan is more important today than ever, as the world faces a choice between autocracy and democracy.\n\nOur delegation’s visit to Taiwan honors America’s unwavering commitment to supporting Taiwan’s vibrant Democracy. Our discussions with Taiwan leadership reaffirm our support for our partner &amp; promote our shared interests, including advancing a free &amp; open Indo-Pacific region.\n\nThis past week, Democrats passed the CHIPS and Science Act— part of our #PeopleOverPolitics agenda: lowering costs, producing better-paying jobs and building safer communities. Click the link below for behind-the-scenes photos this week on ‘Madam Speaker.’ \n\nToday, our nation took a monumental step forward to equip America to meet and beat the challenges of the 21st Century with the CHIPS &amp; Science Act. By sending this bill to President Biden’s desk, Democrats continue to fight for lower costs and more jobs for America’s families. \n\nJoin me at the U.S. Capitol to enroll the #CHIPSandScienceAct. This historic package will lower costs for families, make critical semiconductors in America instead of overseas and turbocharge American science &amp; research - now and for decades to come. \n\nThe House Rules Committee will meet shortly to take up the CHIPS and Science Act. Then, the House will proudly pass this essential legislation and send it to President Biden to be signed into law. \n\nOnce enacted, the CHIPS and Science Act will bolster our nation’s production of semiconductor chips — reinvigorating American manufacturing and creating nearly 100,000 good-paying, union jobs.\n\nWith the Senate’s passage of the CHIPS and Science Act, Congress has taken a key step toward enacting transformative investments to strengthen families’ financial future, boost America’s research advantage and safeguard our economic and national security for generations to come.\n\nDemocrats are fighting to turbocharge semiconductor production with our Chips Act for America – reinvigorating auto plants, creating nearly 100,000 Davis-Bacon jobs, slashing costs for working families and bolstering America’s independence from foreign manufacturers.\n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

As a co-chair of the @China_TaskForce, I’ll continue to fight for action to combat the CCP’s aggression. \n\nThis week, I joined guest hosts @PeterSchweizer and @Eric_Eggers on the @SeanHannity Show to talk about the existential threats that China is waging against our country, and the reason why our leaders don’t want to act to address this. Listen here: \n\nChina is not slowing down. As a member of the China Task Force, I am committed to ensuring we stay ahead of China in every arena. As China becomes more aggressive towards the US, we must push back.\n\nIt’s imperative that we maintain a strong military to stand up to peer threats such as China. But that’s becoming harder with record low recruiting. That’s why I am committed to getting our servicemembers better pay.\n\nThe CHIPS Act will create jobs, fight China, and serve our national security interests. We can't complain about the shortage of car and appliance chips and not vote for this bill. That's why I voted YES. This might not have been the easy vote, but it was the right vote. \n\nI’m joining @GOPLeader, @bikhim, and members of the @China_TaskForce for a conversation about China now. Tune in live: \n\nIf FBI Director Christopher Wray were so concerned about espionage and IP theft by the CCP, the DOJ should never have gotten rid of the China Initiative in the first place. It's time to reinstate the China Initiative and stand up to the CCP. \n\nThe Biden admin seems to not care about the rising gas prices hurting every American family and more concerned with sending our oil reserves to our biggest adversary China. More of this is only going to hurt the US and help China: \n\nThe China Initiative was effective at fighting both IP theft and trade secret theft. But without substantiating rationale by the @POTUS administration, it was canceled this year. I urge my colleagues to join me in fighting to reinstate this initiative. \n\nAs Russia invaded Ukraine, an invasion of Taiwan by the Chinese would make $7 gas prices feel like a bad hair day. Things can get worse. We MUST ensure the US and our allies establish the deterrence to preclude an invasion. China is the real threat.\n\nAs a former Navy fighter pilot, I went on @NewsNation to talk with @LelandVittert about #TopGun, our nation’s military preparedness, and the growing threat of China. #FlyNavy \n\nI spoke at the bicameral, bipartisan Conference Committee on legislation to Combat China. As a member of this conference committee, I’ll fight for policies that put America 1st, advance American innovation &amp; competitiveness, &amp; ensure America remains ahead of China on all fronts! \n\n🚨We must keep our eyes on China.🚨\n\nI’m honored to be appointed to the Conference Committee tasked with producing legislation to combat China and improve America’s competitiveness. We must remember that China is our biggest threat and do all that we can to ensure America remains ahead. \n\nAmerica must keep its eye on China. While chaos ensues around the globe, China remains the greatest threat to our nation's security. China failed to report the COVID-19 outbreak, they continue to threaten our cybersecurity, and they are watching Taiwan. \n\nWe must stand with Taiwan &amp; crack down on China NOW. That's why I sent a letter to @POTUS demanding he \"Turn Up the Pressure\" on China through every economic &amp; diplomatic tool at his disposal to ensure the CCP is not able to support Russia. \n\nAs I have warned- we cannot take our eye off the real threat to the United States: China. The CCP is increasingly pushing for Taiwan to be isolated from United Nations agencies and other international organizations, aiming to establish it as China. \n\n🚨 Reminder: America's adversaries are stronger today because of @POTUS's weak leadership.  Radical Islamic Terrorists  Russia  China  Iran  North Korea\n\n.@POTUS's failed Afghanistan withdrawal continues to have global implications. While the world watches the crisis unfold in Europe, the CCP is negotiating mining contracts with the Taliban. America must not take its eye off of our greatest threat - China. \n\nThe work of @CBP goes beyond our southern border. The CBP recently seized unprecedented amounts of prohibited meat from China in an attempt to smuggle it into the U.S. These prohibited meats can contain diseases that could cripple an entire U.S. industry. \n\nRussia requested military supplies from their friend, China. The U.S. must watch China closely, just as they're watching our every move. America can't afford to reenter another weak JCPOA agreement while our adversaries are analyzing our strength. \n\nA good strategist will never disclose what he will or will not do, but we haven’t seen that with the Biden admin. We must remember that China is watching closely how we handle the situation in Ukraine. #FoxNews\n\nIn America, we stand for freedom &amp; prosperity. Russia, China, Venezuela, and Iran do not.\n\nMake no mistake - China is our greatest threat. Recently, @TheJusticeDept terminated the \"China Initiative\" which was a critical program that sought to protect U.S. laboratories &amp; businesses from economic espionage &amp; property theft. \n\nWhile all eyes are on the tragedy in Ukraine, we must not forget about the biggest threat the U.S. &amp; the world faces: The CCP. China is not our friend. Why is @POTUS sharing U.S. intel with the CCP? \n\nAs the Co-Chair of @China_TaskForce, I joined my fellow lawmakers in writing to the USOPC demanding they take all possible measures to keep our U.S. athletes safe, but also ensure they are properly informed during these unprecedented Olympic games. \n\nChina is not on our team. We have to address the external threat of China, but also the weakness within America- or those that want to bow down to China.\n\nThe “America Concedes Act” not only supports China, but it would cost at least $250 billion and add to our already sky-high national debt. We must stop passing bills that threaten America’s security and economy.\n\nWe cannot allow the CCP to get ahead – but the America Concedes Act does just that. Many of my colleagues in Congress may chastise China briefly on Twitter, but hypocritically will vote for this bill that supports China!\n\nThis legislation is a guaranteed path for the federal government to surrender our competitive edge to the Chinese Communist Party. America can't afford this.\n\n🚨 The radical left’s America Concedes Act not only does little to shame China – mentioning coral reefs more than it mentions China – but it is actually a big help to China. As the Co-Chair of the China Task Force, I will fight against this terrible bill.\n\nIt was an honor to join fellow U.S. lawmakers in meeting with Vice President Ching-te Lai of Taiwan. As China continues to send fighter jets into Taiwan territory, it is more important than ever that we stand with our allies. \n\nThe Chinese Communist Party needs to be held accountable for their gross human rights abuses. We should not be funding a platform to legitimize their actions. \n\nThe Chinese Communist Party is not a friend of the United States. We must make cyber security a priority if we are going to remain competitive with China. \n\nTime &amp; time again, China has shown their ill intention towards America &amp; its allies. I joined my fellow China Task Force lawmakers in calling on the Twitter CEO to hold them accountable. CCP propaganda should not be allowed on their platform. \n\nChina has now backed Russia in their call for security guarantees from the U.S. &amp; stated that they will “face the future hand in hand.\" Meanwhile, @POTUS continues to give hope to these adversary nations. \n\nI'm also pleased that the final NDAA includes funding for several programs that create hundreds of millions of dollars in economic impact in California’s 25th district and support America's critical initiatives to deter China. Full Statement: \n\nDue to the backlog at CA ports, China is paying premiums to get their empty containers back - resulting in American goods failing to be exported. The Biden admin &amp; CA’s policies are putting America 2nd to China. This is unacceptable. \n\nAmericans agree that China is the #1 threat to our nation. Why? 🚨 Our supply chain vulnerability 🚨 The rapid development of China’s military 🚨 Their gross human rights abuses We must surpass China on all fronts.\n\nI’m looking forward to attending the Reagan National Defense Forum at #CA25's @ReaganInstitute this weekend to discuss what must be done to ensure America remains safe, secure, and free. America cannot remain equal with China, we must surpass China.\n\nWe can't keep denying the threat of China. The direction we are headed mirrors the Cold War Era. Now, the Air Force Secretary has used the term \"arms race.\" The greatest concern? We don't have a leader like Reagan &amp; Biden has no nat'l defense strategy. \n\nThe government needs to get out of the way &amp; shift left on the laffer curve, lower taxes, balance the budget, secure our border &amp; hold China accountable.\n\nAccording to a @ReaganInstitute poll, most Americans view China as the #1 threat to America. 71% of Americans are concerned about going to war with China. I share these concerns. We need @POTUS to stand up to China. We can’t continue to bow down to China. \n\nWe need @POTUS to take the threat of China seriously. China just sent a strong message, deploying 18 fighter jets, 5 bombers with nuclear capabilities, and a refueling aircraft.

Meanwhile, he is campaigning with a Congressman with direct ties to a Chinese spy (who got her start through Chen's Confucius Institutes). You can't make this up. \n\nJay Chen's cont. support for a declared Chinese propaganda program in our schools is dangerous. Now he is campaigning with a member of Congress who was compromised by a Chinese spy who got her start at the same Chinese infiltration programs Chen supports. \n\nJust like his support for @BernieSanders, @jfchen has denied and dodged his support for Chinese Communist Party-backed Confucius Institutes. #CA45 \n\nWe must send Chen and any other politician who supports Communist China's propaganda programs a clear message and warning—America will no longer tolerate any support for communist China. Know that as a community we will hold you accountable for your actions.\n\nWe demand candidate Chen denounce and retract any and all support for Confucius Institutes and Communist China.\n\nThis is a dangerous and reckless tactic that goes far beyond campaign rhetoric in a time when China is desperately trying to cover up human rights abuses and declare Taiwan and Tibet indisputably belong to Mainland China. It must stop and it must stop now!\n\nMake no mistake. Democrats, Republicans, and independents have denounced Confucius Institutes as Communist propaganda. What the Chen campaign supports harms and poisons America's place in the world by shamelessly suggesting that Chinese propaganda belongs in our schools.\n\nWe didn’t expect this kind of modern-day support for communism to dominate this election. Nor did we expect this commitment to a Pro-China, communist education program to be a campaign strategy embraced by a congressional candidate, who is himself a Taiwanese American.\n\nIn California’s 45th Congressional District, you see a lot of signs that say “Vote for Michelle! Down With Communism!” or \"Jay Chen is China’s Choice\" because we are committed to highlighting Jay Chen's support for Communist China's propaganda programs.\n\nA thread denouncing Chen's baseless and divisive support for a declared Chinese propaganda program #CA45 \n\nI’m thankful you joined the entire US Senate when you denounced Confucius Institutes. Unfortunately, Jay Chen continues to support the same Communist Chinese propaganda in our schools that you voted to eliminate. It’s just his record. \n\nYou (along with 99 bipartisan colleagues) voted to rein in Confucius Institutes seeing the threat they posed to American schools. Jay Chen supports these Chinese propaganda programs to this day. It's not racism, it's just his record. \n\nA candidate for U.S. Congress still refuses to denounce a declared Chinese propaganda program that he helped bring into US schools. Jay Chen’s record of standing with China speaks for itself. #CA45 \n\nCommunist China’s intimidation and infiltration of American schools and institutions is a grave threat. For as long as I serve in Congress, I will stand against the CCP. \n\nWe know the goal of Confucius Institutes - to teach Communist China's version of history in our schools. Chen doubled down on his support for CIs even after the US government declared it Chinese propaganda. Voters won't forget your record, Jay Chen. #CA45 \n\nJay Chen voted to bring Communist China into our classrooms a decade ago and defended that decision until this year. He is running from his record because he knows he is unfit to represent this district in Congress. #CA45 \n\nThese are the facts: Jay Chen has spent much of his career fighting for a program that the United States State Department officially designated as Communist Chinese Propaganda. #CA45 \n\nICYMI: Jay Chen Stands Alone in His Support for Communist China’s Confucius Institutes #CA45 \n\nHere are the facts. Jay Chen refuses to condemn Chinese Communist Party-backed Confucius Institutes. There is broad, bipartisan consensus that these Institutes are one of Beijing's efforts to infiltrate America. (1\/2) \n\nThe Chinese Communist Party’s rule is a growing threat to our nation and the world. America must not be deterred by Communist China’s hostile behavior. I will continue to stand up against the CCP &amp; ensure America &amp; our allies are prepared + protected. \n\nWhether through Confucius Institutes or their \"police stations,\" the Chinese Communist Party will stop at nothing to infiltrate America while trying to hide their horrible record on human rights. The Biden Administration must get tougher on the CCP. \n\nHis commitment to calling Confucius Institutes “Chinese cultural programs” is EXACTLY what the CCP wants. It’s outrageous that in 2022 he continues to defend a program so clearly exposed as Chinese propaganda.\n\nWhy does Jay Chen still support a program that is an extension of Chinese soft power to brush over their vast human rights abuses?\n\nWhy won’t Jay Chen condemn a program that refuses to acknowledge Taiwan’s independence?\n\n“It’s not hard to envision how they might work, for example, by one day weakening Americans’ loyalty to Taiwan.” \n\n“A group of students and alumni from UMass Boston…wrote a letter to the school’s chancellor expressing deep concern that the university is 'unwittingly assisting the Chinese government to promote censorship abroad, while undermining human rights and academic freedom.'”\n\n“Confucius Institutes teach a very particular, Beijing-approved version of Chinese culture and history: one that ignores concerns over human rights, for example, and teaches that Taiwan and Tibet indisputably belong to Mainland China.” \n\n“Western schools and colleges that take CI money ‘just know’ that you don’t use it to discuss subjects like the Dalai Lama, Taiwan independence, the spectacular wealth of top Communist officials or Nobel Peace Prize laureate and dissident Liu Xiaobo.” \n\nJay Chen refuses to condemn Confucius Institutes and still defends them using Communist China’s own messaging. A few highlights below as to what these “cultural programs” peddle.\n\nWhile my opponent continues supporting China's effort to infiltrate America's educational network via Confucius Institutes, I will never stop pushing to hold the CCP accountable. This action is unacceptable. We must do more to hold China accountable. \n\nIn Korea, my family escaped communism. Now, I'm fighting back against communist China as they try and influence American education and stronghold our institutions. Check out our second TV ad of the cycle! #CA45 \n\nJay Chen is doing China’s bidding by refusing to condemn Confucius Classrooms. This is one of the most pro-China, anti-American, radical positions one can hold at this point and he stands on an island alone. I assure you I won’t stop exposing him. 8\/8\n\nA quick list of those who continue to support Chinese propaganda infiltrating our classrooms: Jay Chen. 7\/8\n\nA quick list of those who have called out Confucius Institutes for what it is - Chinese Propaganda. The ENTIRE U.S. Senate, including Senators Warren, Sanders, Cortez Masto, and Duckworth. Biden’s CIA Director William Burns. The U.S. State Department. The list goes on. 6\/8\n\nJay Chen’s “cultural programs” teach a very specific “Beijing-approved version of Chinese culture and history: one that ignores concerns over human rights, for example, and teaches that Taiwan and Tibet indisputably belong to Mainland China.” 5\/8 \n\nChinese minister of propaganda Liu Yunshan: Coordinate the efforts of overseas and domestic propaganda, [and] further create a favorable international environment for us. We should do well in establishing and operating overseas cultural centers and Confucius Institutes. 4\/8\n\nChina isn’t even hiding it. Li Changchun, former senior leader of the Chinese Communist Party, said that Confucius Institutes are an \"important part of China’s overseas propaganda set-up.” 3\/8 \n\nI want to be explicitly clear: My opponent has supported and continues to support a program that has been unilaterally condemned as a foreign mission of Communist China to infiltrate our classrooms and push their CCP-sponsored propaganda 1\/8\n\n@jfchen is one of the very few remaining supporters of the CCP funded classroom propaganda programs - despite the U.S. State Department’s official designation of it being actual Chinese state propaganda. These radical views have no place in Congress or in American classrooms.\n\n“What’s most troubling is that rather than denouncing something everyone knows is China’s effort to infiltrate America’s education system, Jay Chen continues standing by them,” said James Cho, Fullerton.\n\nJay Chen continues to support CCP Confucius Institutes when our own State Department calls them Chinese indoctrination efforts. He owes voters an explanation. #CA45 \n\nFrom tax hikes to Chinese propaganda, Nancy Pelosi has found her star recruit in Jay Chen. \n\nThis is shocking. The United States must stand with an independent and free Taiwan. \n\nI support a free and independent Taiwan. The United States must stand strongly with our allies as this situation unfolds. \n\nOur dependence on Made-in-China medical products is another reason why medical dye shortage continues. It's critical that we prioritize efforts to produce Made-in-America medical supplies &amp; reduce federal regulations that prevent domestic production of essential necessities.\n\nThe choice in #CA45 could not be more straightforward. My tax fighting, tough-on-China record is proven &amp; extensive. Jay Chen has made clear he has no problem raising taxes, supporting the #CCP, and insulting first-generation Americans. #StandWithSteel \n\nThe Biden Administration needs to do more to limit the influence and reach of China and the CCP. The U.S. must take a stand for free speech. \n\nChina is closely watching how the U.S. responds to Russia’s unprovoked war on a sovereign nation. Democracies around the world are under threat and our leadership now will affect the free world for years to come. \n\nI am honored to receive @mikepompeo's endorsement for my reelection. Under his leadership, America showed unmatched strength abroad and held communist countries like China accountable. I am proud to be working to restore that type of foreign leadership. #CA45 #StandWithSteel \n\n🚨🚨🚨 My opponent spent his time on the school board trying to bring #CCP-sponsored indoctrination efforts into our schools. He still supports these programs today even after the State Department labeled them Chinese propaganda campaigns. \n\nPerennial candidate and socialist Jay Chen has doubled down on his decades-long support of Chinese Communist Party-backed Confucius Institutes, this time, via a fundraising email. Read more here: \n\nIf the Corporate Global Minimum tax goes into effect, it will only hurt American businesses, workers, and families at the worst time while benefiting China and Russia. \n\nTaiwan is an incredibly important ally in the Pacific, and we cannot allow the CCP to influence the delivery of vaccines for the Taiwanese people.

The people of Taiwan should not be subject to these dangerous incursions by the Chinese Communist Party and its military. \n\nWhile these dismissals appear proper, they don't address the significant concerns that remain about the Chinese Communist Party's control of TikTok and ByteDance. \n\nUnder the laws of the People's Republic of China, the Chinese Communist Party potentially has access to the personal data of 140 million Americans who use TikTok at any time without disclosure. \n\nThe ANTI-SOCIAL CCP Act, which I've partnered on with @SenRubioPress and @RepGallagher, is about protecting our national security and ensuring millions of Americans' data isn't leveraged for nefarious means by the Chinese Communist Party. \n\nByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, is required by Chinese law to share the app's data with the Chinese Communist Party. We must take action now to protect Americans' data, and our national security, from foreign adversaries leveraging social media. \n\nAn important step in holding both Russia and China accountable for their conduct. \n\nYesterday, I led a letter to Twitter requesting information about the CCP's potential use of misinformation campaigns on the platform to bury information about protests in the People's Republic of China, and how this could affect U.S. national security. \n\nChinese hackers stealing more than $20 million in government pandemic relief funds is troubling news that must be fully investigated so that we can bring those responsible to justice and ensure that an attack like this never succeeds again. \n\nThanks to the bipartisan CHIPS Act, the first advanced chip plant in the U.S. is set to open in Arizona, another step in our work to get America back to the top of the semiconductor industry globally, while also generating new jobs here in America. \n\nIf the Chinese Communist Party does not de-escalate these violent crackdowns on demonstrators, it will face severe consequences from the international community. \n\nI never thought that K-Pop fans would play a role in fighting the Chinese Communist Party's techno-authoritarianism, but we need everyone to be alert to the threats of Beijing's authoritarianism and ready to resist it. \n\nAnna May Wong broke barriers in Hollywood as the first Chinese American actor in film while overcoming discrimination.

Big Tech oligarchs and fake \"journalists\" tried to hide Biden's corruption from the American people.\n\nLeftists are pushing to replace the farmland we need for food in Illinois with solar panels that are made in China and terrible for the environment. \n\nThe Biden Crime Family sold out the American people to the Chinese Communist Party and made MILLIONS while giving \"10% TO THE BIG GUY!\" The mainstream \"media\" covered it all up, and Big Tech censored it. Democracy Dies In Darkness? With this video: \n\nWe now have a DIESEL CRISIS in America because Joe Biden has been attacking our domestic energy production while pushing Chinese solar panels, windmills, and batteries. President Trump gave us energy independence- Joe Biden is giving us a Cold, Dark Winter! \n\nThe Biden Family was paid $4.8 million by the Chinese Communist Party. We will soon have the oversight power to expose the full extent of your international influence peddling operation, which sold out America and held \"10% FOR THE BIG GUY.\" \n\n🚨The Biden Family was circulating a map of US energy reserves written in CHINESE, literally trying to sell our country's energy reserves to China and holding \"10% FOR THE BIG GUY\" \n\nJoe Biden wants our entire energy grid to look like California, where they have rolling blackouts. Meanwhile, China builds new coal plants! This is an AMERICA LAST agenda!\n\nThe FBI raided teenager Barron Trump's bedroom but refuses to investigate why Hunter Biden was paid millions by the Chinese, Russians, and Ukrainians (was FARA violated?) or what \"10% for the Big Guy\" means. TWO SYSTEMS OF JUSTICE!\n\nIt also includes over $400 billion in “Green New Deal” initiatives, which benefit the Chinese Communist Party because China mines the minerals and manufactures the solar panels and windmills that House Democrats want to subsidize.\n\nThe FBI has a laptop full of evidence that Biden's family held 10% FOR THE BIG GUY while they made deals with Chinese\/Russian\/Ukrainian entities (violating FARA). When is the Biden FBI raid??? TWO SYSTEMS OF JUSTICE!\n\nThe laptop evidence has been in the FBI's possession FOR YEARS. The FBI went after Paul Manafort for the same offenses that are well documented on the 'laptop from hell.' Where are the Biden family FARA registrations for the Chinese, Russian &amp; Ukrainian gov-controlled entities?\n\nIf TODAY the FBI does not raid the homes of the Biden family members who took payments from Chinese communist officials, Moscow officials, and Ukrainian officials while holding \"10% for the Big Guy,\" then we have conclusive proof of two systems of justice.\n\nWhy does every Biden spending bill send so much $ to China and Ukraine? Does it have anything to do with 10% FOR THE BIG GUY? Oversight is coming!\n\nChina SHOULD NOT be allowed to buy farmland in the US! I have a bill that would stop this, but the DC \"Swamp\" exists to protect and defend China's interests!\n\nBiden, Austin and Milley decimated the American military in less than two years with vax mandates, Critical Race Theory and radical transgenderism. The greatest fighting force in the history of the world attacked from within by radical Communists to the benefit of China. \n\nRadical leftists are pushing to replace farmland we need for food with solar panels that are made in China and TERRIBLE for the environment! Hazardous materials with no reclamation process. The windmills are even worse! \n\nI joined @RepLouieGohmert and @RepChipRoy to introduce pieces of legislation that BAN the Chinese Communist Party from buying up our farmland. A huge national security threat! If they control your food, they control your life! \n\nRight now, Congress is voting to weaken our military by voting on amendments that restrict the Second Amendment rights of our troops, instill military gender study requirements, and implement Green New Deal Officers while China builds supersonic missiles.\n\nThe Biden family was paid at least $4.8 million by China's communist government since 2017 and now Joe Biden is selling off our strategic petroleum reserve to China and US energy policy pushes Chinese solar panels, Chinese windmills, and Chinese lithium batteries.\n\nWas Gen. Milley suspended for secretly calling the Chinese and telling them that he would give them a heads up about US military operations? Because that seems worse. \n\nI introduced legislation to ban China's communist government from purchasing US farmland because this is a massive national security threat! \n\nLeftists are angry at the Supreme Court because the Leftist agenda means federal gun confiscation, abortion through the 9th month of pregnancy, bans on praying in public, and unelected EPA bureaucrats with limitless power over your daily life. Sounds a lot like communist China!\n\nI will co-sponsor Sen. @MarshaBlackburn’s legislation in the House from @RepThomasMassie to save our National Guard members from being fired over Biden's COVID vaccine. China is laughing at Biden's incompetence as he fires 40,000 healthy US guardsmen. \n\nPresident Trump was right to withdraw the US from the corrupt, China-controlled World Health Organization. The Biden Admin is selling us out to the Chinese Communist Party! \n\nPresident Trump was right to withdraw our membership from this corrupt globalist organization, and my constituents are horrified that the Biden Administration is empowering the Chinese Communist Party to govern our response to a pandemic caused by China.\n\nThe World Health Organization is corrupt and controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, which is why they lied about the origin and transmission of the Wuhan coronavirus and named the Wuhan coronavirus “COVID-19” at China’s request.\n\nI have been warning about rolling blackouts and electricity hikes for over a year because of the left's war on coal. Made-in-China solar panels and windmills cannot generate enough to replace coal, that's why China is building coal plants and laughing at John Kerry! \n\nBiden wants pain at the pump so he can advance his pro-China Green New Deal! That's why Mayor Pete told you if you cant afford gas, just buy a $60,000 electric car! \n\nHappy #NationalAgDay! I am proud to raise a 4th generation family of farmers because I believe in the family farm as part of the American way of life! I led a bill to prevent China from buying up our farmland because America is on a dangerous path of losing our self-sufficiency. \n\nDemocrats rammed through a 2,741 page, $1.5 trillion spending bill that cuts America’s border security funding and pushes pro-China “Green New Deal” policies instead of increasing American energy production during the Biden fuel crisis. I voted NO on this radical spending bill! \n\nI spoke on the House floor to warn Americans that Biden was pushing Chinese-made batteries and solar panels instead of biofuel in his infrastructure bill!\n\nChina mines lithium and cobalt to manufacture batteries, foreign companies install massive windmills with no reclamation process, and also push to bulldoze trees to cover nature with solar panels.\n\nBiden and the environmentalist lobby want you to believe that American corn farming is worse for the environment than Chinese energy practices. You will once again be told to \"Trust the Science\" while American farming is attacked by foreign interests! \n\nInstead of putting American farmers and consumers first, the Biden Administration is pushing Chinese batteries and Green New Deal policies. The Biden Administration must stop creating uncertainty in the biofuels industry and misleading our farmers about their support for ethanol \n\nInstead of focusing on policies that put American farmers first, the Biden Administration is focusing on Chinese batteries and Green New Deal policies.\n\nIt’s time to put our students first. We now have 8th graders preparing for high school who haven’t had a normal school year since 5th grade. Our country will fall further behind China because weak politicians are afraid to stand up to the woke teachers’ union.\n\nThe Biden Admin failed us. To this day, no one has been held responsible for the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan or the lies told to the American people, and no one has been fired or resigned. China watched this unfold, and our children will pay for Biden’s incompetence. \n\nIt's \"Code Red\" because all of this benefited the Chinese Communist Party. \n\nThis makes sense, no one has been a bigger proponent for Made In China than the \"Green New Deal\" Democrats. \n\nSo China gets a pass while Biden announces new punishments for the American people right before Christmas. \n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

I joined my @WaysandMeansGOP colleagues @RepCarolMiller &amp; @RepAdrianSmith to underscore the importance of US leadership on trade at the first meeting of the Conference Committee on China. \n\nAt today’s @WaysandMeansGOP hearing, I pressed @AmbassadorTai about policies that could allow our intellectual property to fall into the hands of the Chinese government and other bad actors.

I joined my GOP colleagues on the House Intelligence Committee to request a classified briefing on the details of this call. \n\nAmerican values are a core part of the USOPC’s Congressional charter, including a duty to ‘promote a safe environment in sports.’ I joined @GOPLeader, @RepMcCaul, @RepMikeRogersAL, and my @China_TaskForce colleagues to urge the USOPC to protect American athletes at the Olympics. \n\nI opposed the Democrats' CONCEDES Act because it fails to address the generational challenges posed by China. \n\nWe must work together to address the security challenges presented by China, prioritize critical trade initiatives, &amp; counter China’s dangerous economic practices. Unfortunately, Dems tried to leverage these important issues to cynically push forward unrelated liberal priorities. \n\nAddressing the challenges presented by China should be a bipartisan issue. Unfortunately, the Democrats' CONCEDES Act fails to strengthen American competitiveness, protect our innovation, prioritize a proactive trade agenda, or safeguard our national security. \n\nIt's inexcusable that the Biden Admin's SAP on the \"COMPETES Act\" doesn't contain the word \"China\" once.

At today's Ways &amp; Means hearing on US-Africa Trade, I discussed the importance of the US setting global digital trade standards in FTAs. \n\nDems' $3.5T tax &amp; spending spree harms our economic competitiveness to the benefit of countries like China.

This action is long overdue and critical to our national security. Digital platforms must never provide a back door to monitoring by the Chinese government. \n\nThe Chinese Communist Party knows America is on offense following passage of the CHIPS and Science Act. I am confident American innovation and values will prevail in the battle to lead the global economy. \n\nIt's essential that we outcompete China. While progress has been made with my CHIPS and Science Act, there is much more to be done. \n\nAmerica is on offense against the Chinese Communist Party. Thanks to the CHIPS and Science Act, we are increasing domestic chip production to strengthen our national security and protect our supply chains. \n\nThe Chinese Communist Party’s authoritarian reach is extending around the world in order to silence Chinese citizens who have the courage to speak out. Freedom-loving nations must protect against this activity. #BeijingBehavingBadly \n\n\"The recent passing of the federal CHIPS and Science Act was a major step forward for maintaining America’s competitiveness on the world stage.\" \n\nI joined with a bipartisan group of Senate colleagues in a letter to the Chinese ambassador warning the CCP of the consequences of a violent crackdown on peaceful protesters. We must speak up for up for the Chinese people when they are threatened with authoritarian brutality. \n\nThe Chinese Communist Party’s restrictive digital trade policies enable the CCP to exploit data for its authoritarian objectives. To break the CCP’s grasp, the United States must solidify strong, pro-freedom digital trade rules with our partners. \n\nRead my new @TheHill op-ed on how we can break China’s grasp on digital trade.  \n\nThe Chinese people are demonstrating great courage in the face of the Chinese Communist Party’s authoritarian rule. President Xi should back away from his absurd COVID-zero policy instead of cracking down on innocent people who want freedom. \n\nAmazing images from China as large protests have erupted in response to the CCP continuing to restrict the freedoms of the Chinese people. #BeijingBehavingBadly \n\nAn exciting announcement for NSWC Crane and Southern Indiana: more semiconductor jobs are coming to Indiana in the wake of the CHIPS and Science Act. Hoosiers are leading in the emerging technologies critical to our economic and national security. \n\nCritical minerals that go into advanced technologies will be the oil of the next century. We cannot allow China to monopolize these resources and become the OPEC of the future. Kudos to our Canadian allies for identifying the threat and taking action. \n\nI am proud of the role that Indiana &amp; @NAVSEACrane are playing within the @DeptofDefense to utilize resources provided by the CHIPS &amp; Science Act to advance our national security. \n\nIn China, there is no distinction between private businesses and Chinese government and security entities. @TheJusticeDept’s announcement yesterday is yet another reminder of the threat that Chinese tech companies pose to our national security. \n\nHelping Taiwan shore up its defenses to thwart the Chinese Communist Party’s ambitions must be a top U.S. national security priority. Our goal in Taiwan should be to deter an attack in the first place, not just respond if China takes action. \n\nInspiring courage by some Chinese citizens speaking truth to power in the heart of Beijing. They will undoubtedly be punished by the authorities but I pray their acts will encourage more Chinese citizens to fight for a better future than the one imposed on them by the CCP. \n\n“A recent study estimates that a one-year disruption in the production of semiconductors in Taiwan would lead to a $490 billion drop in revenue for electronic-device makers, not counting fallout for sectors that aren’t directly reliant on semiconductors.” \n\n.@Mikepompeo and @VivekGRamaswamy highlight why the threat to Taiwan matters and the potential implications for global supply chains. It’s never been more critical to increase domestic chip production as the CHIPS and Science Act will help do. \n\nToday, I wish the Taiwanese people a Happy Taiwan National Day. I'm proud to stand with Taiwan as they celebrate their freedom, their democracy, and their sovereignty.\n\nAll eyes are on Indiana as we prepare to boost our national security and our workforce through the CHIPS and Science Act. Thanks @SecRaimondo and @SecBlinken for visiting @LifeatPurdue and seeing the work Hoosiers are doing to out-innovate and outcompete China. \n\nGreat to meet with Dr. Dukgeun Ahn, South Korea’s Minister for Trade, to talk about the partnership between our countries. South Korea is an important ally in our global competition with China. \n\nMy CHIPS and Science Act is now law, and America is back on offense against the Chinese Communist Party. Beijing has invested heavily in tech innovation, but with this law, the U.S. is in position to out-innovate and outcompete the CCP in the years ahead. \n\nThe Chinese government continues to commit horrific acts against the Uyghur community. Governments and industry must speak up for those being oppressed. #BeijingBehavingBadly \n\nRead my op-ed on how the CHIPS and Science Act positions Indiana and our nation to out-innovate and outcompete China. \n\nNo sector is safe from this shortage. The new CHIPS and Science Act, which I worked on for over two years, encourages domestic semiconductor production so our Hoosier farmers will not face these challenges in the future. \n\nToday, America goes on offense against the Chinese Communist Party. History will show that by enacting this legislation into law, we are confronting the challenges of today and building a more prosperous and secure tomorrow for all Americans. \n\nGreat to meet with my friend @DrPanch to learn how @NSF is ready to hit the ground running on implementing my CHIPS and Science Act. This will make us more competitive with China, and I am grateful for his vision of unleashing American innovation. \n\nThe Chinese Communist Party is a challenge to American interests not just in the Indo-Pacific but across the Middle East, Africa, and other regions. As we seek to counter the CCP’s influence, the U.S. must remain an engaged global partner for our allies. \n\nThis morning: I joined @WOWOFORTWAYNE to discuss why it was important for @SpeakerPelosi to follow through on her planned trip to Taiwan. \n\nKey line from insightful @JoshRogin column: “Before Pelosi even landed, the Chinese government announced a ban on more than 100 Taiwanese export goods.” \n\nI stand with my Senate colleagues in support of @SpeakerPelosi’s trip to Taiwan. For decades, members of the United States Congress, including previous Speakers of the House, have traveled to Taiwan. \n\nThe landmark China competition bill Congress passed this week was already denounced by the Chinese Community Party. The CCP knows this bill positions America to outcompete and out-innovate their authoritarian regime. America will lead the 21st century. \n\nI joined with @ossoff to introduce a bill to build embassies in Kiribati, Tonga, and Vanuatu to boost our U.S. presence in the Pacific Island region and counter China's growing influence. @alexbward \n\nThe Chinese Communist Party does not dictate travel plans for Members of Congress. Speaker Pelosi should travel to Taiwan whenever she wants. Bending the knee to Beijing only invites aggression. We must stand with Taiwan. \n\nThe Senate passed landmark China competitiveness legislation and now the House will take it up. Many of the bill's key provisions are recommendations by House GOP’s @China_TaskForce. I hope the House will support this critical national security bill. \n\nThe Senate just passed landmark legislation to help our country outcompete and out-innovate the Chinese Communist Party. This is a massive win for our economic and national security. \n\nHeaded to pass my China competitiveness bill \n\nThe Senate will soon vote on my bill to help us outcompete &amp; out-innovate the Chinese Communist Party. History will show that by passing Chips-Plus we are confronting the economic &amp; national security challenges of today &amp; building a prosperous &amp; secure tomorrow for all Americans. \n\nSpeaker Pelosi should follow through on plans to visit Taiwan and send a message to the Chinese Communist Party that we stand with our ally. \n\nThis morning, the Senate voted to advance my bill to outcompete China and boost domestic chip production. I joined @BloombergTV to discuss why this legislation is critical to our national security. \n\nBeijing has been very clear about its desire to forcibly bring the vibrant democracy in Taiwan under its communist rule. We must stand firm and be unambiguous about support for Taiwan’s independence. \n\nI joined @SquawkCNBC to discuss today’s Senate vote on the CHIPS-Plus bill and the national security imperative of passing this legislation. \n\nRead my @nwi op-ed on why passing my bill to outcompete China will increase our economic and national security. \n\nAs the Senate moves closer to passing a bipartisan bill to outcompete China, a reminder that Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party do not want this legislation to become law. What’s bad for the #CCP is good for the United States. \n\nIf the U.S. is to deter an invasion of Taiwan, we must boost the readiness of their military, deliver the capabilities they require, and clarify that we won’t accept any attempt to conquer this vibrant democracy and valued partner. \n\nMy bill to outcompete China will make possible new chip research and production investments in the U.S., like @SkyWaterFoundry’s announcement that it will invest $1.8 billion in a new Indiana facility. It’s time to get this bill across the finish line. \n\nTonight’s procedural vote is an important first step toward the Senate passing a robust “CHIPS Plus” package. The strong bipartisan vote shows there is broad support for including the USICA provisions critical to our national security and ability to outcompete China.\n\nAuthoritarian regimes in Russia, China, and elsewhere are using economic intimidation to influence countries around the globe. My new bipartisan bill will help our partners stand up to these regimes when targeted. \n\nSome foreign adversaries, like China &amp; Russia, think they can drive a wedge between Western allies by using economic intimidation. When America provides targeted support to our partners under threat, we also protect our own national security interests. \n\nAnother example of #BeijingBehavingBadly -- the Chinese Communist Party employing hackers and a global network of spies to steal Western technology companies’ intellectual property. \n\nExciting news for our state – today @MediaTek announced plans to create its first Midwest semiconductor chip design center in partnership with @LifeAtPurdue. This center will create jobs, drive collaboration, and deepen ties between Taiwan &amp; Indiana. \n\nA major example of #BejingBehavingBadly is China profiting from the forced labor of Uyghurs. @JoshRogin is right - the Biden Administration needs to fully enforce the law Congress passed to cripple China’s forced-labor industry. \n\nChinese company ByteDance, which owns TikTok, had access to data of American users for months. We need answers from the Biden Administration on how it is enforcing a 2020 executive order addressing TikTok’s national security and privacy risks. \n\nIt is time to bring cutting edge research &amp; development and manufacturing back home. As @ericschmidt and @GrahamTAllison point out, every day we delay passing my #USICA and CHIPS Act funding, we fall further behind in this global competition. \n\nWhen China controls the technology, everything, including your data, is used on their terms. #BeijingBehavingBadly \n\nJoined @BloombergTV to discuss the situation in Ukraine and the national security imperative of passing my legislation to help the U.S. outcompete and out-innovate the Chinese Communist Party. \n\nChina, Russia, &amp; COVID have demonstrated the significant threats facing our global supply chains. Partnering with allies in our own hemisphere &amp; here at home to build the economy of the future will reduce these risks and bolster our national security. \n\nWith the Chinese Communist Party threatening Taiwan, securing our supply of semiconductors is of vital importance to our national security. We need to pass my #USICA legislation in order to make critical investments in homegrown chips manufacturing. \n\nAmerica is almost entirely reliant on other nations for high-tech computer chips that power our smart phones, automobiles, household appliances, and military platforms. U.S. semiconductor production, once accounting for nearly 40% of the world’s supply, has dropped to just 12%.\n\nReada bipartisan message from @GovHolcomb &amp; @GovWhitmer on why Congress needs to pass my #USICA legislation. This critical bill will bolster domestic chips manufacturing and bring new cutting-edge jobs to Indiana. \n\n#ICYMI: Last week, I joined @Indiana_EDC’s Global Summit in Indianapolis to share how my #USICA bill will help the U.S. outcompete and out-innovate China through critical national security investments, including regional tech hubs. \n\nJoined @BloombergTV to discuss the baby formula shortage affecting Hoosier families and why Congress must pass my #USICA bill to outcompete the Chinese Communist Party. \n\nAs President Biden visits Asia, it is crucial that he emphasizes the need to support Taiwan’s defense and build upon the lessons learned from Ukraine. Together we must deter China’s aggression toward Taiwan. \n\nThe United States is facing a global challenge from the Chinese Communist Party. I discussed why passing #USICA is critical to ensuring the U.S. leads the world into the future. @fdd Watch: \n\nThe Chinese Communist Party is not a partner or merely a competitor. The CCP is an adversary who manipulates the rules to grow its power and influence. I spoke about how my #USICA bill will hold China accountable &amp; reinforce America’s global leadership. \n\nAmerican leadership in science and technology is vital to out-competing and out-innovating China. My #USICA bill will ensure the U.S. is leading the world into the future. @LTGHRMcMaster said it best – we need to “work together and get this darn thing done.” \n\nJoined @LTGHRMcMaster in a conversation hosted by @FDD to discuss how we can leverage American innovation to counter the Chinese Communist Party and advance our national security. \n\nI spoke during today’s first conference committee meeting on my #USICA bill to outcompete the Chinese Communist Party. We have a national security imperative to ensure that we continue to lead the world in the development of cutting edge technology. \n\nWe must not lose out on innovation and production to China.\n\nWe cannot compete with China without robust domestic R&amp;D. Last night, in a bipartisan vote, the Senate passed a motion I sponsored with @SenatorHassan to restore incentives for long-term R&amp;D investment &amp; expand the refundable R&amp;D tax credit for startups &amp; small businesses. \n\nAs @MarcoRubio and I requested in March, the SEC is investigating @DidiGlobal. Good. We need more action protecting Americans from Chinese surveillance and unfair business practices. \n\nThe Chinese Communist Party continues its aggressive attempts to acquire U.S.-based technology, particularly for semiconductors. The Biden Administration must use the tools Congress has given it to protect our country from these subversive efforts. \n\nAuthoritarians continue to make up false narratives to justify their aggression. Taiwan is a sovereign nation and a critical partner. #StandWithTaiwan \n\nWe must be clear-eyed about the threats China and Russia pose to America and our allies. A great power struggle is underway. If we fail to prepare for it or build a plan to win it, America will forfeit the future.\n\nOutgrowing, out-innovating, and outcompeting China by unleashing the talents of American innovators and workers in all parts of the country is a national security priority.\n\n“The 23 nations that voted with Russia included the usual suspects Cuba, North Korea, Syria, Iran, Belarus—and China.” #BeijingBehavingBadly \n\nSpoke with the @MedicalAlley’s Board of Directors this week about the initiatives I’m working on – including the#PASTEURAct to create antibiotic-resistant medication &amp; the #USICAChina competition bill – as we consider the future of healthcare and innovation. \n\nEnjoyed meeting with Taiwan’s Representative to the U.S. @bikhim this morning. Taiwan is on the frontlines of Chinese aggression in the Indo-Pacific, and I’m proud to stand in support of this important ally both today and in the future. \n\nThe need to crack down on the #CCP is apparent. Joined @KeithJKrach at @cpa_tradereform’s conference to talk about how my China competitiveness bill will accelerate our growth in technology &amp; manufacturing so the U.S. can lead the 21st century. #USICA \n\nData is one of our most valuable commodities, we must ensure it is protected and not exploited by authoritarians in China or Russia. \n\nI joined @marcorubio in a letter to @SecBlinken, @SecDef, and @SECGov about the risks posed by ride-hailing firm @DidiGlobal’s links to the Chinese Communist Party. \n\nHonored to receive a Khata, a Tibetan welcome scarf, during my meeting with leaders from #Tibet &amp; the Representative of @DalaiLama. Whether in Bloomington or Washington, I’m always proud to stand with Tibet in the face of aggression by the #ChineseCommunistParty. #FreeTibet \n\nTwo auto plants in Indiana are idling due to the chip shortage. We must pass #USICA to safeguard our workers and our economy from global disruptions and stay ahead of the Chinese Communist Party by making investments at home. \n\nThanks @SecRaimondo for inviting me to join this important bipartisan discussion with national security leaders from previous Administrations. We have a national security imperative to ensure we don’t fall behind China in our technological innovation. \n\nTonight’s vote is the next procedural step for #USICA which preserves U.S. leadership in emerging tech &amp; prevents China from prevailing. To my colleagues, join me in voting to advance the bill and let’s work to improve the final product in a conference committee.\n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

I want to highlight some of these issues.\n\nThe @WTA is making the right choice by putting people over profits and they are an example for anyone doing business in China. The #CCP's draconian actions must not be ignored. #WhereIsPengShuai \n\nIt's not enough for China to stifle the free speech of its own citizens. It seeks to mute prominent voices here in America, and all too often it works. I applaud @EnesKanter for speaking out against the #CCP and all those who publicly &amp; vocally support freedom. \n\nChina must be held accountable for the atrocities they are committing against the #Uyghurs and Muslim minorities. This week, the Senate passed the Uyghur Forced Labor Protection Act to make certain the #CCP cannot profit from slave labor on American soil. \n\nAs a member of the Senate Taiwan Caucus, I look forward to strengthening our relationship with Taiwan, a vibrant democracy and partner of the United States.\n\nMet w\/ Ambassador @bikhim to discuss Kansas &amp; Taiwan's robust trade, sharing vaccines &amp; the threat China poses to Taiwan.

Communist China is using TikTok as a weapon against the United States by collecting data and keystrokes from millions of Americans. TikTok is a huge national security risk, and there is no reason this CCP spyware should be on government-issued devices. \n\nI commend the protesters in China who are standing up for individual liberty and pushing back against the #CCP's draconian COVID-19 lockdowns. We must stand with the men and women who are putting their lives on the line for freedom. \n\nCommunist China’s connection to TikTok is a clear threat to our national security. I'm proud to cosponsor @RepDustyJohnson's #BlocktheTok Act to prohibit the CCP from using TikTok to access Americans' personal data &amp; block the installation of TikTok on U.S. government devices. \n\nIt's illegal for DHS to import solar panels from Communist China that have been made using Uyghur slave labor. I joined @GOPoversight to ensure American taxpayer dollars are not being used to fund genocide and abuse in China's Xinjiang region. \n\nCommunist China currently owns over 350,000 acres of American farmland. The United States should not allow one of our biggest adversaries to be involved in American agriculture. This puts our food security at risk and gives the CCP inroads into our most critical infrastructure. \n\nDrug cartels are smuggling fentanyl from China across our southern border in record numbers. In the first 6 months of last year, Kansas saw a 54% increase in drug overdoses—half were tied to fentanyl. The border crisis continues to impact communities and families across Kansas. \n\nA record 107,000 Americans died of drug overdoses last year—71,000 caused by fentanyl. The cartels are getting rich by pushing this deadly drug from China across our wide-open southern border and into our communities. It’s time to take action. It’s time to secure the border. \n\nThe World Health Organization has proven to be a corrupt organization that continues to do China’s bidding. I called on POTUS to withdraw from the #WHO &amp; stop using our tax dollars to fund an organization that is clearly NOT working in the best interests of the American people. \n\nCommunist China has not followed through on their trade commitments to Kansas farmers &amp; ranchers. I joined my colleagues, led by @RepMann, to demand that POTUS take action to hold the #CCP accountable for the billions of dollars they owe American agriculture producers.  \n\nFentanyl overdoses are the leading cause of death for Americans ages 18-45. These narcotics are produced by China, trafficked across our wide-open southern border by the cartels, and brought into our Kansas communities. We must secure the border to stop this deadly crisis. \n\nThe pandemic brought to light how crucial it is that we end our reliance on Communist China for life-saving medications and medical supplies. I am proud to co-sponsor the Protecting American Lives Act that lifts regulations to help bring medical supply chains back to the U.S.  \n\nThe Chinese Communist Party cannot be trusted. I'm proud to support the GENOCIDE GAMES Act, by @RepGallagher, that would sanction IOC officials if athletes, fans, or other participants are detained, disappear, or are otherwise deprived of their rights during the Olympics.  \n\nToday is the first day of the Winter Olympics in Beijing. Yesterday, Speaker Pelosi warned American athletes not to speak out against the human rights atrocities and malign activity happening in Communist China. Why is Speaker Pelosi trying to protect the #CCP? \n\nI voted NO on Speaker Pelosi's COMPETES Act. Instead of working on a bipartisan basis and putting America's interests first, Speaker Pelosi moved forward with a bill that leaves our nation even more vulnerable to China's malign activity. My full statement  \n\nThe CONCEDES Act comes with a price tag of $325B &amp; wastes hard-earned taxpayer dollars on far-left provisions that are completely unrelated to Communist China. Instead of holding the #CCP accountable, this bill leaves our nation even more vulnerable to China’s malign activity. \n\nIt's vital that we work together to protect America's interests and push back against Communist China, but Speaker Pelosi's $325 billion \"CONCEDES ACT\" is not the answer. Instead of holding the #CCP accountable, this bill is just another liberal wish-list. \n\nSpeaker Pelosi is mandating that Members of Congress wear KN95 masks in the Capitol. To make matters worse, the Speaker is using taxpayer dollars to purchase thousands of masks that are MADE IN CHINA. The House should only be buying products that are MADE IN THE USA! \n\nFentanyl is now the NUMBER ONE killer of Americans ages 18-45. This deadly drug comes from China, across our southern border, and straight into our neighborhoods. We MUST secure our border to stop this crisis from harming our Kansas communities. \n\nToday, the National Defense Authorization Act for FY22 was signed into law! This legislation will give our troops a much-needed pay increase, push back against China and Russia, and ensure our military has the resources it needs to defend our nation at home and abroad. \n\nI was proud to support this legislation in the House that prevents goods made with Uyghur slave labor from being imported to the United States. Communist China must be held accountable for their continued genocide and human rights violations against the Uyghur people. \n\nI'm proud that the House passed legislation last night that would ban all imports from Xinjiang until Communist China proves that their products are not made with forced labor. The #CCP must be held accountable for the genocide they have committed against the Uyghur people.\n\nA diplomatic boycott of the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing is not nearly enough. The U.S. must hold the CCP accountable for their continued human rights violations, increased aggression towards Taiwan, and for the national security threat they pose to our nation and our allies.\n\nI'm proud to join this effort to get to the bottom of how billions of dollars of COVID-19 relief aid was stolen by our foreign adversaries, including China and Russia. Kansans deserve accountability for the mismanagement of their hard-earned taxpayer dollars. \n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

It's another huge step forward in creating good-paying American jobs and securing our domestic supply chains.\n\nI was honored to work with Kansas Senator Jerry Moran to get the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act across the finish line. It’s a great example of how we can work together to build a better future – with more jobs and lower prices. \n\nI worked w\/ Republicans &amp; Democrats, including Kansas Senator Moran, to help finalize a major bipartisan economic law – the CHIPS &amp; Science Act. It's all about making more products and jobs here in America – not China. See our email update for more &gt;&gt; \n\nThe CHIPS and Science law is about securing our supply chains, lowering costs, and creating better paying jobs. It’s time to keep moving forward and build on this hard-fought progress. The last thing anyone needs right now is more extremism, division, and empty promises.\n\nAnything is possible when Kansans work together. I worked w\/ Republicans &amp; Democrats as a negotiator to pass a big, bipartisan economic law – the CHIPS &amp; Science Act. I was honored to serve w\/ Sen Moran on the committee so we can make more products &amp; jobs in America, not China. \n\nI proudly voted for the CHIPS and Science Act because an investment in domestic manufacturing is an investment in #KS03.\n\nThe Chips and Science Act will help fix our supply chains, create good-paying jobs, tackle inflation, and improve America’s competitiveness. I joined local technology and manufacturing leaders to chat about how this will benefit our community. \n\nFrom General Motors to Cherub Medical Supplies, #KS03 is becoming a hub for American manufacturing. Funding from the recently-passed CHIPS and Science Act will support the good work of our local manufacturing businesses and their workers. \n\nThe CHIPS and Science Act will lower costs for Kansas businesses and families and help make more goods here at home. I’m proud to support local businesses like @JEDunn and appreciate their collaboration! \n\nToday, I held a roundtable with local tech and business leaders, who reiterated Kansas is ready to be a national leader in manufacturing. The bipartisan chips legislation I supported will help us get there, all while strengthening our families’ financial future. \n\nThis week, the House passed my bipartisan bill to extend the @FCC's spectrum auction authority, which has raised $230B in revenue without new taxes. This  can help us improve rural broadband, close the digital divide, and keep us competitive against China. \n\nI voted YES on the #CHIPSandScience Act to fix our supply chains, create good-paying jobs, &amp; lower costs for families and businesses. I’ve been working to get this direct relief to KS for months, and while I celebrate this major win today, I will get right back to work tomorrow. \n\nI’m serving as a key negotiator alongside @JerryMoran on a major supply chain and innovation bill aimed at increasing America’s competitiveness against countries like China. To put it simply, it's time we make more goods right here at home. \n\n@shamrocktcorp Read more on how Registered Apprenticeship programs enable us to better compete against countries like China and tackle inflation by making more here at home. \n\nLast week, we started negotiations on a major, bipartisan package to boost American manufacturing, reduce inflation, and stand up to China. Glad to work across the aisle to create a future that’s made in Kansas. \n\nWe kicked off negotiation today on major supply chain and pro-manufacturing legislation. I’m ready to work across the aisle to get this thing done. We’ve got the innovation, the talent, and the grit to compete against countries like China. I’m ready to start betting on our team. \n\nAddressing inflation is a top priority for me. And one crucial way we can do that is by securing our supply chains so we can make more products and jobs in America – not China. See my recent email update for more on how we can Make it in Kansas: \n\nWe’ve been losing manufacturing jobs to China for years. We saw how dangerous that can be as medical supply shortages hampered our ability to fight COVID early on. But we also saw our small and mid-sized manufacturers step up to fill those gaps when we needed it most. (1\/2)\n\nToday, I met with @POTUS alongside @NewDemCoalition Leadership Members. I thanked him for his attention on lowering costs and urged him to turn those words into actions. A great place to start is passing a bipartisan package to make more goods and jobs in America—not China. \n\nThe path to fixing our supply chain, addressing rising prices, and staying competitive against countries like China starts here at home. I voted to invest in our talent &amp; manufacturing capacity, and I went to see it for myself in Olathe last week. \n\nThanks @RonawkLLC and @kms_kansas for showing me around and talking with me about building up our supply chain, supporting domestic manufacturing, and helping train our workforce to compete against countries like China.\n\nThe Fairfax General Motors plant went dark for months last year due to the chips shortage. Ongoing supply chain issues are still driving up prices on cars across the country. We have the know-how, we have the workers. We should be making more of these critical materials at home. \n\nThis is the investment we need to address rising prices, remain competitive globally and hold countries like China accountable. Plus, it includes my amendment, which gives small and mid-sized manufacturers the opportunity to participate in these new supply chain policies.\n\nThe House just introduced legislation to strengthen domestic manufacturers and make chips here at home. This is exciting news - these chips help #KS03 from the GM plant in Fairfax to the folks on waitlists for CPAP machines to anyone looking to buy a used car.\n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

I will be reaching out to Apple to request that they address this issue publicly and explain their recent actions in China to the American people.\n\n.@WhiteHouse, and @POTUS have nothing to say to Tim Cook about this? As a member of the @HouseForeignGOP, I am deeply concerned about an American company playing any part in the brutal crackdown of free expression in China.\n\nWhy is @Apple, a U.S. company created by one of the greatest American innovators of our time, acquiescing to the Chinese Communist Party’s demands to disable airdrop features on IPhones, aiding and abetting the CCP in quelling protests in China? \n\nI could go on, but next Congress, @HouseForeignGOP, Chairman @RepMcCaul and the House Select Committee on China will fully expose Biden’s failed policies on China.\n\nHe’s never confronted Xi for the CCP lying about COVID, enabling a worldwide pandemic that killed millions. He’s never confronted Xi over the flood of fentanyl manufactured in China that is flowing through our border into communities and killing thousands of young Americans.\n\nPresident Biden won’t stand up to the Chinese Communist Party. The White House’s lack of support for protestors in China is an absolute disgrace. This continues Biden’s weakness on China. \n\nThe Chinese Communist Party assaults, arrests and hauls off journalists for shining a light on Xi’s brutality. This is what actual oppression looks like. #ChinaProtests \n\nBrave protestors in China are saying enough is enough with the repressive regime in Beijing. No more authoritarian COVID lockdowns in China or elsewhere. God bless the Chinese people standing up for freedom against Xi. The U.S. stands with them all the way.\n\nI’m about to go live with @JackPattietalks to talk inflation, rising crime, and my trip to Taiwan. Listen live  \n\n4⃣ The United States Trade Representative and Congress should not only fast track a bilateral free trade agreement with Taiwan, the Biden State Department should end its senseless policy of excluding Taiwan from the new Indo-Pacific Economic Framework.\n\n3⃣ The United States must help Taiwan establish greater deterrence by accelerating Foreign Military Sales of lethal defensive anti-ship and anti-air weapons to the island immediately; and\n\nThis involves missile tests, air incursions over the Taiwan Air Defense Identification Zone and warship maneuvers designed to effectively erase the median line in the Taiwan Straight;\n\n2⃣ The CCP’s increasingly belligerent and unprovoked aggression against Taiwan includes cyber attacks, disinformation and military exercises in the Taiwan straight.\n\nThe most important takeaways from my trip to Taiwan are: 1⃣ Taiwan is a free and democratic society that must be defended;\n\nThank you to Taiwan President @iingwen, Foreign Minister Joseph Wu, National Security Council Secretary-General Wellington Koo and members of the Legislative Yuan for hosting us. @MOFA_Taiwan\n\nAs the Chinese Communist Party increases its unjustified military aggression against the island, and as Xi and Putin meet tomorrow to strengthen their alliance, American support for Taiwan is more important now than ever. \n\nLast week, I participated in a critically important bipartisan congressional delegation trip to Taiwan. \n\nDemocrats have been weak on China’s human rights abuses. Earlier this Congress, House Dems blocked my bill requiring companies to disclose any ties to business operations involving Uyghur slave labor in China. @HouseGOP will be tough on the CCP in 2023. \n\n.@GOPLeader has created the #CommitmentToAmerica w\/ @HouseGOP tackling everything from the economy to China. \n\n.@VivekGRamaswamy Total HYPOCRISY. @BlackRock chokes off investment in American energy production costing jobs &amp; driving up prices. But they’ve never seen an energy project or economic development initiative in China not worth investing in. \n\nDems poisoned CHIPS by readying a massive tax, borrow, and spend package despite our economy entering a recession. Although I support a targeted bill to incentivize domestic production of semiconductors, I cannot vote for an agenda that will send us off a cliff. Full statement  \n\nThe NDAA also funds the Pacific and European Deterrence Initiatives, key for halting military aggression by Russia in Eastern Europe and the Chinese Communist Party in the Pacific.\n\nGreat meeting with Legislator Lim and Legislator Hung who serve in Taiwan’s Legislative Yuan. We discussed the U.S. and Taiwan’s strategic partnership as well as ongoing efforts to secure a bilateral trade deal with Taiwan and the need to speed up American arms sales to Taiwan. \n\nApproximately 80% of solar panel production occurs in China and it is likely that Uyghur slave labor is used to manufacture them. We must continue to confront the Chinese Communist Party over their human rights abuses. Thank you to Enes for leading the charge!\n\nGreat to see former UK Wildcat @EnesFreedom in the halls of Congress today. Enes’ fight for human rights in China is more important now than ever. This week, the Biden Administration ended tariffs on solar panels imports. \n\nGreat event w\/the @scicoalition this week. I talked about boosting research for valvular heart disease through the CAROL Act. I also discussed the upcoming China bill &amp; the importance of American competitiveness. \n\nThe alliance between China &amp; Russia threatens the U.S. &amp; our allies. I introduced the AXIS Act to require @StateDept to submit ongoing reports to Congress detailing China’s support for Russia before &amp; since the invasion of Ukraine. Today, the House passed my bill. My speech  \n\nThe Chinese Communist Party poses a serious military, economic and technological threat to the United States and our allies. After calling the CCP a diversion, I am pleased that Speaker Pelosi and Democrats are finally engaging with Republicans on China. \n\nGoing live on @Newsmax with @HeatherChilders. I will outline my bill requiring the State Dept to report to Congress on China’s support for Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. We will also discuss my bill to fully close the energy loophole in our sanctions related to Russian energy. \n\nI’m leading the AXIS Act, requiring @StateDept to report to Congress on the support given by the Chinese Communist Party to Russia before &amp; during the invasion of Ukraine. The unholy alliance between the CCP &amp; the Kremlin is a serious threat to the United States and our allies. \n\nGreat dinner with Kentucky Wildcat and champion of human rights @EnesFreedom. We discussed how we could collaborate to hold the Chinese Communist Party accountable for its gross human rights violations and expressed disappointment with the NBA for silencing criticism of China. \n\nI strongly condemn the Chinese Communist Party following Russia’s playbook with its military aggression against Taiwan. The world is watching, and that includes General Secretary Xi. President Biden needs to act decisively to thwart our adversaries aggressions.\n\nIs the NBA really that beholden to Chinese Communists? If so, they should be ashamed.\n\nFormer Kentucky Wildcat @EnesFreedom is a champion for human rights &amp; freedom. He is still at the top of his game. Now, the @NBA is disgracefully punishing him for his criticism of the brutality of the Chinese Communist Party. #DoTheRightThing \n\nInstead of building on the work of the @China_TaskForce, Pelosi rushed a $350B deficit spending bill to passage without a CBO score. Almost $10B to a climate slush fund &amp; preferential treatment for unions. No thanks!\n\nToday, I voted against Pelosi’s America Concedes to China Act. The China Task Force that I serve on issued a report w\/82 key findings &amp; more than 400 recommendations, two thirds of them bipartisan. Pelosi’s bill completely disregarded the work of CTF. @BloombergTV \n\nI am calling on both the USOPC and the State Department to do what is required to keep our athletes competing in Communist China safe, and to minimize their vulnerability to CCP surveillance and malign influence.\n\nThe @China_TaskForce on which I serve has called for the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee (USOPC) to prepare athletes for the threats they face and inform them of the human rights atrocities perpetrated by the Chinese Communist Party.\n\n.@SpeakerPelosi should take notes from @China_TaskForce. CTF produced a report w\/400+ policy recommendations, two-thirds of which are bipartisan. We must stop the Pelosi and enact a real plan to confront the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nDems’ $350B “China proposal” is their big govt socialist bill 2.0  $10B for a climate slush fund  $45B “supply chain resiliency” program that favors labor unions  Mentions coral reefs more times than China  Refers to climate change 2X more than national security \n\nTo boost U.S. production of chips and to lower prices, I am pushing to fund the CHIPS Act. Speaker Pelosi should stop holding CHIPS funding hostage for a 2,900 page bill with an $8 billion climate slush fund.\n\nPrices for new automobiles spiked 47% last year. The shortage of semiconductor chips is fueling the increase. Chips are used in smart technology that exist in every new vehicle. Only 12% of chips are produced in the United States. @ABC36News \n\nQuestion: How tough can you be on the CCP when you are reportedly doing multi-million dollar deals with known CCP spies in Beijing? Answer: You can’t. Biden has been weak on China every step of the way. Maybe now we know why… ⁦@nypost⁩ reports  \n\nIn Congress, I am pushing for $52 billion to fund the CHIPS Act to boost domestic semiconductor production to support U.S. auto manufacturing.\n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

He’s clueless. Joe Biden and Stacey Abrams are extremists who support abortion on demand up until birth putting the United States in the league of China and North Korea. \n\nYour policies on abortion are in line with China and North Korea - not the developed world.\n\nStacey Abrams and Democrats in Washington support abortion on demand – without restriction – up until the moment of birth. That is the policy in places like North Korea and China – it should not be in the United States.\n\nThe Biden-Harris-Schumer proposal puts America in line with communist China and North Korea, where abortion is available until the moment of birth.\n\nThe Biden-Harris Administration has the country on the wrong track when it comes to border security, immigration policy, crime, national security – and now they want to put us on the Chinese and North Korean track of abortion on demand up until the moment of birth.\n\nRonna @GOPChairwoman got it absolutely right! Democrat efforts to allow taxpayer-funded abortion on demand to the moment of birth is extreme and cruel. That’s China and North Korea, not America. Well done Ronna! \n\nThis legislation strengthens the relationship between the United States and Taiwan in terms of economic and military cooperation. It is vital that we send a signal – not only to Taiwan, but also to China – that America stands firmly with our democratic ally Taiwan. Well done.\n\nVery pleased to see that the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, under the leadership of Chairman Menendez and Ranking Member Risch, passed the Taiwan Policy Act of 2022 that I cosponsored with Senator Menendez.\n\nAs usual, @marcorubio is spot-on. The media will never expose the fact that Democrats want no restrictions on abortion and would allow it up until the moment of birth, making our country like China and North Korea. Thanks for the strong leadership Marco. \n\nTo oppose this legislation takes you out of the mainstream of the world. The Democrat desire for abortion on demand up until the moment of birth puts us in a club of seven that includes North Korea and China.\n\nIt's very fashionable right now to be hard on China. I can say this: I was hard on China before it was cool. \n\nWe can't let China tell us where to go and what to do. So the idea of Speaker Pelosi going to visit Taiwan is a good thing, in my view, because the Chinese Communist Party is no friend of freedom or democracy. \n\nSpeaking with @JesseBWatters on @FoxNews just a few minutes about Taiwan and Afghanistan. Tune in!\n\nSpeaking with Brian @kilmeade on @foxnewsradio about China, Afghanistan, congressional spending, and more. LISTEN NOW: \n\nFor that to happen, the Chinese Community Party needs to change its provocative behavior towards the region and the world.\n\nI applaud the Speaker’s decision to visit at this crucial time in our country’s relationship with Taiwan and over time hope for better relationship with mainland China.\n\nVery pleased to see @SpeakerPelosi has arrived in Taiwan to reinforce our support for the freedom-loving people of Taiwan. This visit is not a change in U.S. policy – it is reinforcing the long-standing relationship between the democracy of Taiwan and the United States.\n\nWhile no piece of legislation is perfect, this bill helps America control our own destiny when it comes to high-end chip manufacturing. When it comes to chips, America is now in the game. \n\nChips are an essential part of our economy – from washing machines to the automotive industry to rockets. This legislation dramatically increases the ability to manufacture high-end chips in America. It will make us far less reliant on foreign nations for our chip production.\n\n@SpeakerPelosi In my view, closing Taiwanese air space would be an act of war against the United States. We must stand our ground against Chinese communist bully tactics.\n\n@SpeakerPelosi I appreciate Speaker Pelosi wanting to make this trip and urge the Biden Administration to reject any attempt by China to disrupt this travel.\n\nI hope @SpeakerPelosi will stick with her planned visit to Taiwan to reassure our Taiwanese democratic ally of America's continued support. \n\nOur military capabilities in the region must be enhanced along with that of our partners like Taiwan.\n\nAbandoning Taiwan to communist China would be abandoning democracy itself. It would lead to major cracks in world order and world security that would take generations to recover from.\n\nPresident Biden’s statement that if push came to shove the U.S. would defend Taiwan against communist China was the right thing to say and the right thing to do.\n\nIf Putin is stopped in Ukraine and eventually replaced, China will be far less likely to invade Taiwan. Having just returned from Taiwan, I can assure you that Asia is watching the fight between Russia and Ukraine. \n\nChina is part of the problem. Austria’s objection to EU membership by Ukraine is part of the problem as well.\n\nThis decision seems like something from the communist Chinese Politburo system where a handful of people - in an arbitrary and capricious manner - can simply deny voters a choice of voting for a candidate of their own choosing.\n\nSpeaking of clowns and jokes…have you heard the one where the Chinese Communist Party said China had nothing to do with starting Covid? Or how about the one about the Uigher population being given government sponsored “vacations” and not being put in concentration camps? \n\nIn Case You Missed It: Press conference by the US  congressional delegation - @SenatorMenendez, @SenatorBurr, @senrobportman, @SenSasse &amp; @RepRonnyJackson - visiting Taiwan . ⏯ WATCH: \n\nHonored to be in #Taiwan where freedom reigns.

These protestors are BRAVE, have earned our respect, and deserve our prayers.\n\nWhile this is a step in the right direction to keep Chinese threats to our national security at bay, this can only accomplish so much with the Biden Admin. encouraging the widespread use of Chinese software like TikTok.

The grid is not equipped to handle an EV fleet of this magnitude. \n\nThis is un-American, and our Founders would no doubt be appalled. Americans cannot afford this legislation or its destructive implications from the doubling of the IRS Army, increasing our reliance on China, raising taxes on Americans and small businesses …\n\nAnd we KNOW the “BIG MAN” met with the Chinese, facilitated Hunter’s business dealings, and probably got kick-backs!

While we struggle with surging gas\/energy costs, the President is sending oil out of our SPR to China.

The theory that economic interdependence will prevent conflict was debunked by Putin. The CCP is on a dangerous path and you don’t want to be caught in the fallout. \n\nEarlier this week, WH official John Kirby was asked about the President’s reaction to the protestors in China chanting “freedom!” His response? We’re “not going to speak for protestors.” Interesting. They had no problem endorsing BLM protests, right? \n\nFreedom is a natural state. Humans yearn for freedom—as we’re seeing across the globe in China, Iran, and Cuba—among others. They don’t need much from the US. Just moral support, and recognition for their righteous cause of freedom. But Biden stays silent, of course.\n\nThere’s only one reason I’m at COP27, &amp; that’s to do what Democrats won’t—advocate for real solutions to America’s energy crisis. We can’t rely on countries like China to offer us “clean” energy solutions. We have every opportunity to be energy independent. \n\nTHREAD: This week, Michael Bloomberg announced an all-out war on the petrochemical industry, targeting Texas as part of an $85 million campaign to outsource American manufacturing to China. Here’s why this is a horrible (and hypocritical) idea. \n\nThe Chinese Communist Party can go straight to hell. You don’t tell us when our elected representatives can visit other countries, as they always have, since our nation’s inception. No amount of toddler-esque saber rattling will change that.\n\nRep. Dan Newhouse recently introduced legislation to stop the Chinese Communist Party from buying up U.S. farmland. Dan Newhouse’s primary election is next Tuesday. Vote for Dan Newhouse. We need serious people. \n\nGod bless Shinzo Abe and the Japanese people today. He was a true leader, and a strong and committed ally of the American people. Abe was a fighter who recognized the threat from China and demanded unity in standing up to it. He will be missed but never forgotten.\n\nAnd now, while we deplete our reserves, China is *increasing* their fuel reserves almost barrel for barrel what we’re decreasing from ours. China now controls the world’s largest stockpile of oil at around 950M barrels. We weakened our stockpile and helped our biggest adversary.\n\nFCC Commissioner Brendan Carr is right. After recent revelations there’s no more arguments to let China’s Tik Tok keep spying on Americans \n\nThese are not mutually exclusive issues either, and to treat them as such is to admit we can’t walk and chew gum. But we can. This is America, and we aren’t putting America first when we leave our border open or let Russia and China reshape the global order to their liking.\n\nAnd given the option to severely degrade the Russian military’s capabilities for years to come, without sacrificing a single American soldier, allowing us to focus on more serious threats like China, then hell yes I’ll make that investment.\n\n2. Fortify alliances- for every ally we let fall, ten more will falter when we need their support. The least we can be doing is lethal aid for Ukraine that kills our enemies without sacrificing a single US soldier. It is the world - not just the US -versus China and Russia.\n\nRussia and China are openly challenging the West. We must accept this reality, and act accordingly: 1. Achieve global energy dominance - especially in oil, gas, nuclear, and rare earth mining. Leverage is gained when we are not dependent on Russian energy or Chinese minerals.\n\nDay 1 of the Winter Olympics and the CCP has already physically pulled a Dutch reporter off air. Where are the woke NBA, Nike, and Hollywood China apologists? \n\nIt shouldn’t be hard to support US athletes standing up for American values against Chinese oppression. But even that’s too much for Pelosi. Unbelievable. \n\nHey @nytimes in addition to expanding their economy you forgot China also expanded internment camps, forced sterilization programs, their surveillance state, genocide, and pretty much just terrible things in general. Great reporting. \n\nThe Russian buildup along the border with Ukraine is the result of a feckless administration. This is the cost of the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal: allies and partners like Ukraine, the Baltics, Georgia, and Taiwan are under threat because our enemies see weakness. \n\nGreat! Now on to actual solutions: China buys more of our natural gas, which burns a third of the emissions of Chinese coal. Both economies prosper, while drastically reducing global emissions. But no one at COP26 wants to hear that. Makes too much sense. \n\nSure cuz why not make this bill even WORSE by also rewarding Chinese labor camps. \n\nI don’t think the “disappointed dad” strategy is gonna work here, Joe. China runs concentration labor camps to build coal plants. They deserve to be punished, not coddled. \n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

Ukrainians are destroying Putin's army. Freedom is winning across the globe.\n\nJoe Biden agreed to pay $1 billion in climate reparations to foreign nations for climate change. The world's largest polluter, China, will pay $0. American taxpayers deserve better!\n\n1,070,947 Americans have died from COVID-19. Instead of holding China accountable, Joe Biden is talking about climate change with Xi Jinping.\n\nJoe Biden: 'No one is building new coal plants because they can’t rely on it.'

How many barrels will Biden sell the communists this time around?\n\nChina has detained over 1 million Uyghurs against their will. Forced labor, sterilization, and indoctrination at the hands of the Chinese Communist Party. Thank you @IngrahamAngle for highlighting Citigroup CEO Jane Fraser's refusal to condemn China's genocide against Uyghurs. \n\nChina is national security threat #1. The CIA's mission is to protect our Nation from threats. That's why Americans deserve answers on 20 members of the Chinese Communist Party working under CIA Director Burns at a D.C. think tank.\n\nAs Vice President, Joe Biden met with TWO Chinese energy executives in the West Wing. As President, Biden's Inflation Corruption Act provides billions to INCREASE our reliance on China. This tweet speaks for itself.\n\nChina produces 79% of all lithium-ion batteries for electric vehicles. This is why Joe Biden's goal of shutting down American energy is a huge national security threat.\n\nTaiwan is not part of China. Pass it on.\n\nChina is America's greatest national security threat. The communists cannot be allowed to dictate our foreign policy. I urge the Biden Administration to formally recognize Taiwan as a free and sovereign nation. \n\nHillary Clinton sold U.S. uranium to Russia. Joe Biden sold U.S. oil reserves to China. But President Trump was the national security threat?\n\nHow much money did Hunter Biden make from Joe Biden selling our oil reserves to China?

I’m thankful for Rep. Langevin’s many years of leadership &amp; look forward to working with Rep. Slotkin to continue bolstering US cybersecurity. \n\nChina has built a hypersonic weapon faster than anything in the U.S. — and it's built on the backbone of American technology. My amendment in the NDAA helps the U.S. catch up and prepare for the threats of today's world. \n\nGreat news: The Senate voted overwhelmingly to pass the #NDAA, which contains several of my bills to address fentanyl trafficking, combat the Chinese Communist Party’s malign influence, hold Russia accountable for war crimes, and much more.\n\nThe NDAA also includes my amendment to strengthen our Defense Industrial Base, plus my: • Taiwan Policy Act—to deter CCP aggression in Taiwan • War Crimes Deterrence Act—to prosecute &amp; stop Russian war crimes • Cyber Diplomacy Act—to keep regimes from censoring truth online\n\nFrom the collapse of Afghanistan to Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and rising threats from China, the Biden administration has projected weakness and left our nation vulnerable. These global threats and the administration’s open border policies make a dangerous combination. \n\nMore than 75,000 Americans have died from synthetic drug overdoses in the past year, yet President Biden made no mention of fentanyl—often sourced from China—in his meeting with Xi Jinping. It’s time the president started protecting American lives by standing up to the CCP. \n\nI discussed the importance of my recently passed CHIPS Act with @KVUE yesterday. Watch  \n\nRight now, Taiwan produces 90 percent of all advanced semiconductors chips, and the threat of a Communist China takeover of Taiwan is real. Securing our supply chain is a matter of national security and must be a top priority. \n\nSemiconductors are the brains behind all technology that keep our nation safe. The passage of the CHIPS for America Act is a huge win for the American people, Texas, and our national security. Proud to accept the CHIPS Champion award from SIA! \n\nThe CHIPS for America Act is a critical piece of national security legislation that will ensure semiconductors are made in America - including in Texas. That’s why I wrote the CHIPS for America Act with President Trump’s national security team in 2020. \n\nAs the author of the CHIPS for America Act, I fought for over 2 years to push this bill across the finish line. Without chip production in the U.S., our national defense would be at risk and we would be leaving jobs and investment overseas. \n\nI am pleased to see the CHIPS for America Act signed into law.  \n\nPassing the CHIPS Act is critical to our national security. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join me in voting for this critical bill. My statement  \n\nWe must embrace the leaders and new companies that can quickly help us meet today and tomorrow’s security needs, especially as they relate to the global malign threat of the Chinese Communist Party.\n\nWeakness invites aggression, and this administration must step up and show our adversaries that the U.S. won’t make the same mistakes we did with Russia when it comes to our adversaries like Iran and China. Thanks, @greta, for having me on your new @newsmax show, The Record! \n\nMy CHIPS act would spur tens of billions in additional investments in U.S. semiconductor manufacturing, improving our security and creating thousands of jobs.\n\nIt’s critical to our national security that we ramp up U.S. production of advanced semiconductor chips and Texas is the best choice for manufacturing and development. \n\nExcited to hear NXP Semiconductors is considering Austin for its $2.6B expansion. Congress must fund the CHIPS for America Act to incentivize domestic manufacturing of this critical technology, secure our supply chain, and create high paying American jobs!\n\nWeakness invites aggression, and the Biden administration’s weakness on the world stage has emboldened our adversaries. We cannot afford to make the same mistakes we did with Afghanistan and Ukraine when it comes to China. Now more than ever, we must prioritize national security. \n\nExcited to hear @TAMU was awarded another grant by @DeptofDefense to continue their hypersonic research! TAMU is at forefront of our national security efforts, and hypersonic missiles are critical to countering threats from our adversaries like Russia and China.

Getting rid of reliable energy sources will have MAJOR negative consequences!\n\nDo not underestimate Biden’s corruption. He’s pumping oil over to a Chinese energy company Hunter has ties to. Biden won’t stop until he’s sold off the ENTIRE country!!\n\nCorrupt Pelosi brought her son along when she went to Taiwan. Was he checking on his “investments?” She is taking a page straight from the “Biden Crime Family’s” handbook! Don’t be surprised if her son ends up on the board of directors for some dark-money energy company!\n\nWAKE UP! Joe Biden is using the FBI to go after President Trump!! ARE YOU KIDDING ME!! Democrats are voting to double the size of the IRS so they can come after you for MORE of your hard-earned paycheck. Is this the Soviet Union or Communist China? They MUST be stopped!\n\nBiden is BANKROLLING the Chinese Communist war-machine. He just sold 6 million barrels of oil from our VERY OWN strategic reserves to a Communist party-affiliated company. If China invades Taiwan, the blood will be on BIDEN’S hands!\n\nIf the “progressive” idiots on the left want to come after me for a gun post defending our 2nd Amendment rights, they should use someone who doesn’t sleep with the enemy! Eric Swalwell is a threat to our national security! He actually sleeps with Chinese Communist spies!! WOW! \n\nDo you think Chinese spy fetishes — like the one demonstrated from this elected leader — increase or decrease the likelihood of high ranking members of our government being totally comprised by a Communist country that hates us? \n\nBiden must've forgotten he’s AMERICA'S President. He sells our oil to CHINA, blames gas prices on PUTIN, and he’s made the TALIBAN the richest arms dealer in the world. Americans are POORER because of his policies. The country is a MESS because of his cognitive decline!\n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

Weighed in with @statesman: \n\n🚨 Key win for Central Texas: Our CHIPS Plus Act just passed the House, despite significant, last-minute Republican opposition. Headed to the President's desk. \n\nTheir stated reason is that Manchin has apparently agreed to a modest number of measures on taxes, health, and climate incorporated into Inflation Reduction Act. Real reason is to notch cheap wins by blocking any progress on important CHIPS+—no matter the loss to Central Texas.\n\nHow petty: MAGA Republican House members—including some with Central Texas districts—are following the lead of Trump cheerleader Kevin McCarthy in opposing bipartisan CHIPS+ legislation so important to our tech, economic, and national security.\n\nThrough this bill, we hope to fully fund #CHIPSAct + provide tax incentives for this vital part of our supply chain. Already home to so much development, Central TX is a natural fit for new investment by @MicronTech to ensure supply of the chips which fuel so much of our economy.\n\nWith Senate action on the COMPETES Act finally underway, I met with @MicronCEO in the Capitol to discuss the strategic importance of rebuilding U.S. semiconductor manufacturing—particularly memory chips, of which @MicronTech is the only domestic manufacturer. \n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

We need to know how Biden is going to keep China and this platform in check!

I wonder why? \n\nBiden is destroying all the progress we’ve made to stop Communist China’s infiltration in our educational institutions. He’s playing right into their hands. I wonder why? \n\nAmerica produces the world's cleanest energy via natural gas, nuclear, pipelines, etc. The Left's war on fossil fuels is leaving a massive void that China, Russia, and others are filling. A reality that's bad for everyone. \n\nOf course, the admin avoids answering exactly why NOTHING is being done about China buying huge swaths of land near U.S. military installations. Like the southern border, it’s another unaddressed national security threat. \n\nUnsurprisingly, the Biden admin is allowing U.S. companies to violate the law and do business with Chinese companies that use Uyghur slave labor. Our leaders need to enforce the law and hold these corporations accountable! \n\n.@POTUS could solve the energy crisis he created by unleashing U.S. production. Instead, he’s sending what little oil we have left to Communist China. Read my @dcexaminer op-ed below  \n\nReportedly, not only did @POTUS supply Communist China with oil meant to strengthen our national security, but he also conveniently chose a company that Hunter Biden is a part-owner and investor of. Why is this not being talked about by the liberal media?\n\nWe know the @WHO lives in the hip pocket of Communist China. It’s a corrupt institution and deserves zero of your tax dollars. I’ve joined @RepAndyBiggsAZ’ bill to withdraw U.S. support! \n\nBiden's solution to his self-made inflation crisis is to make us MORE dependent on Communist China. Don't forget: Biden and the Democrats' reckless spending got us here. \n\nPrivileged to sit down with Representative @bikhim today to discuss the importance of a robust U.S.-Taiwan alliance and the steps Congress should take to keep it that way! \n\nThe @WHO is in Communist China's pocket, yet Biden wants to send them OUR private health information. The same country responsible for the COVID pandemic. The same organization Trump tried to pull us out of. @POTUS: Focus on AMERICA’s healthcare &amp; stop bowing to China's puppet.\n\nThe Chinese Communist Party has infiltrated our universities in order to steal our intellectual property\/research. The CCP's a real threat, yet Biden's woke DOJ killed the program dedicated to ending this espionage. It's unthinkable, and I'm demanding answers! \n\nI sat down with @capitolreport to discuss the future of our sovereignty under Biden's failed policies and the latest in space as we compete with Communist China. Polar opposite topics made for an interesting interview - watch below! \n\nThink about a government forcibly removing your organs against your will - a horrifying thought. Communist China has been doing it to people for years. We must hold them and anyone else contributing to this heinous business accountable. \n\nWhile Biden's wasting millions of our tax dollars handing out free crack pipes, Russia and China are strengthening their hypersonic missile programs. This president's weakness emboldens our adversaries daily. \n\nWhen the words \"coral reef\" appear TWICE as many times as \"national security,\" you know the #AmericaCompetesAct is a partisan joke. This bill has nothing to do with competitiveness or holding China accountable. It's just another liberal wish list. \n\nIn true Dem fashion... if you're losing a debate, just call your opponent a \"racist.\" The #AmericaConcedesAct caters to the Chinese Communist Party. The GOP's concerns have zero to do w\/ race. If we can't debate a bill &amp; push back on the CCP, Americans aren't being well-served. \n\nThe #AmericaConcedesAct proves the Democrats are more interested in Communist China’s success than our own - empowering Beijing with bad policies and American tax dollars. You deserve better. \n\nThe Democrats’ nearly 3,000-page “America Competes Act” empowers Communist China while making us weaker and less safe. This bill isn’t about competing, it’s about conceding. Take a look for yourself  #AmericaConcedesAct \n\nWhat happens when we’re only allowed to buy zero-emission vehicles? We become even more dependent on Communist China. Does that sound smart? No. My colleagues and I are pushing back on Biden’s executive orders! \n\nUnbelievable. Pelosi spent YOUR hard-earned tax dollars to buy thousands of Chinese-made KN95 masks. When will the Democrats start putting America above Communist China? \n\nThe ABCs of Biden’s first year: C = COVID, Crime, and China Three promises made. Three promises broken.

It’s time to secure our border and do everything we can to stop these dangerous substances from impacting our communities. \n\nThe 2022 Winter Olympic Games are in the shadow of the Chinese Communist Party’s malign behavior &amp; human rights atrocities. The U.S. Olympic Committee has a responsibility to ensure that Team USA athletes are informed about the Uyghurs genocide &amp; the threat to athlete security. \n\nThe atrocities of the Chinese Communist Party cannot go unchecked. We must hold the CCP accountable. \n\nChina continues to aggressively expand their nuclear arsenal and increase their military capabilities at a breathtaking speed. Now more than ever, we must make sure that our military has adequate resources to defend ourselves against China and protect our national security. \n\nHypersonic missile tests are a chilling display of the CCP's intentions &amp; should be a wakeup call, including about our flawed export control &amp; licensing policies w\/ China. I sent a letter to Sec. Raimondo along w\/ the @China_TaskForce on the need to address this immediately: \n\nGrowing threats and human rights violations from the Chinese Communist Party must be taken seriously — not brushed off or ignored. I joined China Task Force colleagues in calling for Biden Admin officials to immediately receive a threat briefing on the dangers of the CCP:\n\nAmerica must continue to lead. We cannot live in a world where the Chinese Communist Party sets the rules of the road globally, and we must take urgent steps to not allow that to happen. \n\nWe cannot convey weakness in the face of growing threats and aggression from China. Failing to adequately fund our military does just that and jeopardizes our national security. \n\nWhile China and Russia are making significant investments to build up their militaries... the Biden Admin’s budget fails to adequately fund our Defense Dept. The proposed budget is insufficient for us to maintain our superiority and defend ourselves against the threats we face. \n\nAmid growing threats from our adversaries, President Biden has not made challenging Chinese and Russian aggression his top priority. We can't put politics before our military readiness and national security. \n\nAmericans deserve transparency &amp; answers about the origin of COVID-19. The Chinese Communist Party has to be held accountable for their actions. \n\nWe have to be absolutely clear that we will defend Taiwan against increased aggression and hostility from the Chinese Communist Party. We must stand with Taiwan, with democracy, and with freedom. \n\nBetween China’s assault on freedom around the world, Russia’s continued cyberattacks, and Iran’s pursuit of a nuclear weapon… our adversaries represent a serious threat to our country and our way of life. Biden's budget is highly irresponsible as we face these growing threats.\n\nAmerican energy independence is critical to our national security. Biden's energy policies — including cancelling the Keystone Pipeline while waiving sanctions against the Nord Stream II — are a gift to our adversaries like China, Russia, &amp; Iran. \n\nThe threat posed by the Chinese Communist Party is real. We must respond with strength. \n\nWe must counter China's rapid military buildup. It's irresponsible &amp; dangerous for Pres Biden to spend trillions on liberal priorities, but call for an inflation-adjusted cut to the Defense Dept. when military leaders tell us we need real growth to keep up w\/ our adversaries. \n\nToday we mark the 32nd anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Massacre &amp; honor the courage of those who stood up to the Communist Chinese regime. We remember the millions who died at the hands of communists &amp; rededicate ourselves to standing w\/ those who are fighting for freedom. \n\nEvery American deserves answers about the origin of the virus and actions by the Chinese Communist Party to cover it up. I joined my House Republican colleagues in calling for a full investigation into the origins of COVID-19: \n\nFormer President Trump’s claim that our electoral system can't function and that democracy has failed spreads the dangerous rhetoric of the Chinese Communist Party. We all have an obligation to speak out against those efforts. \n\nThe Chinese military represents a rapidly growing threat to our security as they expand &amp; modernize their nuclear capabilities. Congress must provide the resources necessary to defend our nation. It is our most important obligation. Watch my exchange on this earlier today: \n\nFrom Russia to the Chinese Communist Party to Iran and North Korea, our adversaries are testing this new Administration. So far, the Biden Administration has chosen to respond with weakness which does not serve our national security interests. \n\nGreat to speak w\/ my friend @HughHewitt this morning about the importance of stopping Democrats’ efforts to gut our defense budget and ensuring that America can defend ourselves, our allies and our interests against China’s malign activity.

China will take full advantage of it. President Biden needs to show backbone and make sure that Taiwan has what it needs to defend itself. It must be painful for China if they go after Taiwan. \n\nChina is the new battlefield of the 21st century. It's not just weaponry, it's information. As China tries to be the military, economic, and the technological superpower of the world, we can't stop. We have to continue to work to stop them from allowing that to happen. \n\nThe Supreme Court today ruled to return power back to states to legislate in a way that reflects the will of their voters.

American self-sufficiency and our freedom are at stake. \n\nWe need to focus on America's self-sufficiency. We shouldn't be dependent on anyone. That means uranium from Russia, critical minerals from China, &amp; oil from OPEC. Europe is wide awake about what happened when they bought energy from their enemies. @POTUS is still sleep walking. \n\nLed @EnergyGOP this morning in a letter to @POTUS calling on him to restore America’s energy dominance. Our letter lays out 10 sensible steps to regain our energy dominance &amp; put the brakes on Russia &amp; China’s energy-fueled geopolitical ambitions. \n\nPresident Biden must respond with crippling sanctions on Russia immediately. The world is watching – especially China. If Putin gets away with this, it will embolden China to move against Taiwan.\n\nPutin doesn’t respect statements, he only respects strength. He views President Biden as weak and ineffective especially after the way we exited Afghanistan. If Putin is able to invade Ukraine easily, it’s a concern that other countries like China will be able to do the same. \n\nChina's goal is unmistakable. It wants to become the world's one dominant power. Since day one, the Biden administration has been caught flatfooted. It's time for Democrats to wake up to this threat from communist China before it is way too late. \n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}

It is almost 3,000 pages with a $325 billion price tag. The bill does not hold the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) accountable for their horrendous actions. This bill mentions “coral reefs” more times than China.\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi wants American athletes to ignore human rights atrocities in China and encourages them to play nice with the Chinese Communist Party. Welcome to the 2022 Winter Olympics! \n\nPresident Biden tonight has proudly laid out his job-killing anti-energy actions. #JointAddress In the process of destroying American energy jobs, Biden is making America more and more dependent on countries like China and Russia for energy. \n\nThe US &amp; #Taiwan share a strong partnership. The #CCP continues to exercise control over the @WHO and is preventing Taiwan’s participation in WHA. Taiwan’s medial expertise, experience &amp; effective response to #COVID19 would be invaluable in this annual meeting. #LetTaiwanHelp\n\n","entities":[],"relations":[],"Comments":[]}
